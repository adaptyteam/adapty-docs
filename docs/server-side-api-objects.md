## Objects

Adapty API has JSON objects so you can understand a response structure and wrap it into your code.

All datetime values are [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), for example, "2020-01-15T15:10:36.517975+0000".

### CustomerAccessLevel

Info about customer’s [access level](access-level).

Configure which products unlock premium \(paid\) features in your app using the Adapty Dashboard. Then, check in the app for the access level available for a user, for example  in the way below \(in Swift \)

```swift
if (profile.paidAccessLevels["premium"]?.isActive == true) {
    /* Grant user access to paid functions of the app */
}
```

### Subscription

Info about vendor subscription. You don’t have to use this object in most cases, **CustomerPaidAccessLevel** is the preferred way to work with access to the app. When using this object, you need to implement processing logic for each subscription period \(a week, a month, a year, lifetime\).
