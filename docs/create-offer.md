Adapty allows you to offer discounted pricing to existing or churned subscribers. To use this feature, you need to first [create the offer in App Store Connect](app-store-offers) and/or [create the offer in Play Console](google-play-offers). Once you have the offer ready in the app stores, you can easily add it to Adapty:

1. Open the **[Paywalls and Products](https://app.adapty.io/products) **section from the Adapty main menu, then select the **Products** tab.

   
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img 
    src="https://files.readme.io/6b9e928-edit_product.png" 
    style={{ width: '70%', border: '1px solid grey' }}
  />
</div>



2. Find the product to which you want to add an offer and in the **Actions** column, click the **3-dot** button next to the product and select the **Edit** option.
3. In the opened **Edit product** window, click the **Add Offer** button below the **Offers** title.  

   
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img 
    src="https://files.readme.io/b0e04fe-add_offer.png" 
    style={{ width: '70%', border: '1px solid grey' }}
  />
</div>



4. In the added new empty line, enter the offer you wish to add to the product.

   Here are the fields for the offer:

   - **Offer name:** Provide a name for the offer to help identify it within Adapty. Use whatever name is convenient for you.
   - **App Store Offer ID:** This is the unique identifier of the offer [you set in the App Store](app-store-products).
   - **Play Store Offer ID:** Similarly, this is the unique identifier of the offer [you set in the Play Store](android-products).
5. Click the **Save** button to save the newly added offers to the product.
