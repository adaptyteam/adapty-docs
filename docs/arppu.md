### ARPPU

The Average revenue per paying user (ARPPU) chart displays the average revenue per paid user. It displays the actual revenue generated by paying customers, divided by the number of customers, minus refunds.

### Calculation

The ARPPU chart is calculated as:

ARPPU = Revenue / Number of users who paid

For example, if your app generated $10,000 in revenue over a given period and had 500 paying customers during that time, the ARPPU would be calculated as $10,000 / 500 = $20. This means that on average, each paying customer generated $20 in revenue during the selected period.

 It's important to note that the ARPPU value displayed represents the sum of total revenue divided by the total number of paying customers. The calculation is done before the store's fee and the refund amount is excluded from the revenue. As one user can pay more than one time during the whole period, the total ARPPU value may be higher than the daily value of ARPPU. This metric provides valuable insights into the revenue-generating capabilities of your app's paying user base and can help you optimize your pricing and subscription strategy to maximize revenue generation.
