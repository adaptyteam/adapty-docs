The Installs chart shows the total number of users who have installed the app for the first time, as well as any reinstalls by existing users. This includes multiple installations by the same user on different devices. Please note that incomplete downloads or installations that are canceled before completion are not counted toward the install count.

### Calculation

The calculation logic for the Installs chart provided by Adapty involves counting the total number of times the app has been installed by both new and existing users, including any reinstalls on different devices. However, incomplete installations or downloads that were canceled before completion are not included in the total count.

Please note that If your app has in-app user authentication, the Installs chart may also include the count of new logged-in users who have accessed your app multiple times. For more details please check our [SDK documentation](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/identifying-users) for identifying users
