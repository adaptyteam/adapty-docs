A [Placement](placements) designates a specific location within your mobile app where a paywall or A/B test can be displayed. For example, a subscription choice might appear in a startup flow, while a consumable product (such as golden coins) could be presented when a user runs out of coins in a game. You have the flexibility to showcase the same paywall or A/B test across multiple placements or different paywalls or A/B tests in one placement for different user segments, called audiences in Adapty.

To edit an existing placement:

1. Open the **[Placements](https://app.adapty.io/placements)** section in Adapty main menu.

2. In the **Placements** window, click the **3-dot** button next to the placement and select the **Edit** option.  

   
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>

    src="https://files.readme.io/e04a93a-edit_placement_list.png" 
    style={{ width: '700px', border: '1px solid grey' }}
  />
</div>




3. In the opened **Edit** window, make the changes you need. For more details on the options in this window, please read the [Create placement](create-placement) section.

4. Click the **Save and publish** button to confirm the changes.
