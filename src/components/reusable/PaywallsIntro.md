<!--- PaywallsIntro --->


This guide will help you to display a paywall created in the [Adapty Paywall builder](adapty-paywall-builder.md) in your app.

Paywalls created with the Builder render automatically once configured, and, in your app code, you only need to:

1. **Get the paywall**: Get the paywall from Adapty.
2. **Display the paywall**: Show the paywall container you've got in your app.
3. **Check subscription status before displaying the paywall to a specific user**: Get their current access level and don't display the paywall to your premium users.
4. **Handle button actions**: Associate user interactions with the paywall with your app's response to them. For example, open links or close the paywall when users click buttons.
