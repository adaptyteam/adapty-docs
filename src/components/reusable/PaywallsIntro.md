To enable any kind of in-app purchases, you need to understand how Adapty structures purchases:

- **Products** are anything available for purchase – subscriptions, consumables, or lifetime access.
- **Paywalls** are configurations that define which products to offer. In Adapty, paywalls are the only way to retrieve products, but this design lets you modify offerings, pricing, and product combinations without touching your app code.

This guide will help you to display a paywall created in the Adapty Paywall builder in your app:

1. **Get the paywall**: Get the paywall from Adapty.
2. **Display the paywall and delegate handling purchases to Adapty**: Show the paywall container you've got in your app.
3. **Handle button actions**: Associate user interactions with the paywall with your app's response to them. For example, open links or close the paywall when users click buttons.
