<!--- FallbackPaywallIntroduction--->

To maintain a fluid user experience, it is important to set up [fallbacks](/fallback-paywalls) for your [paywalls](paywalls) and [onboardings](onboardings). This precaution extends the application's capabilities in case of partial or complete loss of internet connection.
