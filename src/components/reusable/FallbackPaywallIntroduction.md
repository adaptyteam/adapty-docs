<!--- FallbackPaywallIntroduction--->

:::warning
Fallback configurations require Adapty SDK v2.11 or up.
:::

To maintain a fluid user experience, it is important that you set up a [fallback configuration](/fallback-paywalls) for your [paywalls](paywalls) and [onboardings](onboardings). That way, if the user encounters connection issues or server outages, the application will display a complete paywall anyway.

:::important
Before you follow the steps in this guide, make sure you [download the fallback configuration files](/local-fallback-paywalls) from Adapty.
