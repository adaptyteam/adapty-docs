The 1003 error, `cantMakePayments`, indicates that in-app purchases can't be made on this device.

If youâ€™re encountering the `cantMakePayments` error, this is usually due to one of the reasons:

- Device restrictions: The error is not related to Adapty. See the ways to fix the issue below.
- Observer mode configuration: The `makePurchase` method and the observer mode can't be used at the same time. See the section below.


## Issue: Device restrictions

|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Screen Time restrictions	 | Disable In-App Purchase restrictions in [Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102470) |
| Account suspended         | Contact Apple Support to resolve account issues         |
| Regional restrictions	    | Use App Store account from supported region             |

## Issue: Using both Observer mode and makePurchase

If you are using `makePurchases` to handle purchases, you don't need to use Observer mode. [Observer mode](https://adapty.io/docs/observer-vs-full-mode) is only needed if you implement the purchase logic yourself.

So, if you're using `makePurchase`, you can safely remove enabling Observer mode from the SDK activation code.
