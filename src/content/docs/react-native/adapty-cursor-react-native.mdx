This guide helps you integrate Adapty into your React Native app with the help of an LLM. You'll start by preparing your Adapty dashboard, then work through each implementation stage by sending focused doc links to your LLM. At the end, you'll find best practices for setting up your AI tools with Adapty documentation.

:::tip
Copy this entire page as Markdown and paste it into your LLM to get started — click **Copy for LLM** at the top of the page or open [the .md version](https://adapty.io/docs/adapty-cursor-react-native.md). The LLM will use the guide links and checkpoints to walk you through each stage.
:::

## Before you start: dashboard checklist

Adapty requires dashboard configuration before you write any SDK code. Your LLM cannot look up dashboard values for you — you'll need to provide them.

### Required before coding

1. **Connect your app stores**: In the Adapty Dashboard, go to **App settings → General**. Connect both App Store and Google Play if your app targets both platforms. This is required for purchases to work.
   [Connect app stores](integrate-payments.md)

2. **Copy your Public SDK key**: In the Adapty Dashboard, go to **App settings → General**, then find the **API keys** section. In code, this is the string you pass to `adapty.activate("YOUR_PUBLIC_SDK_KEY")`.

3. **Create at least one product**: In the Adapty Dashboard, go to the **Products** page. You don't reference products directly in code — Adapty delivers them through paywalls.
   [Add products](quickstart-products.md)

4. **Create a paywall and a placement**: In the Adapty Dashboard, create a paywall on the **Paywalls** page, then assign it to a placement on the **Placements** page. In code, the placement ID is the string you pass to `adapty.getPaywall("YOUR_PLACEMENT_ID")`.
   [Create paywall](quickstart-paywalls.md)

5. **Set up access levels**: In the Adapty Dashboard, configure per product on the **Products** page. In code, the string checked in `profile.accessLevels['premium']?.isActive`. The default `premium` access level works for most apps. If paying users get access to different features depending on the product (for example, a `basic` plan vs. a `pro` plan), [create additional access levels](assigning-access-level-to-a-product.md) before you start coding.

:::tip
Once you have all five, you're ready to write code. Tell your LLM: "My Public SDK key is X, my placement ID is Y" so it can generate correct initialization and paywall-fetching code.
:::

### Set up when ready

These are not required to start coding, but you'll want them as your integration matures:

- **A/B tests**: Configure on the **Placements** page. No code change needed.
  [A/B tests](ab-tests.md)
- **Additional paywalls and placements**: Add more `getPaywall` calls with different placement IDs.
- **Analytics integrations**: Configure on the **Integrations** page. Setup varies by integration. See [analytics integrations](analytics-integration.md) and [attribution integrations](attribution-integration.md).

## Implementation walkthrough

The rest of this guide walks through Adapty integration in implementation order. Each stage includes the docs to send to your LLM, what you should see when done, and common issues.

### Plan your integration

Before jumping into code, ask your LLM to analyze your project and create an implementation plan. If your AI tool supports a planning mode (like Cursor's or Claude Code's plan mode), use it so the LLM can read both your project structure and the Adapty docs before writing any code.

Tell your LLM which approach you use for purchases — this affects the guides it should follow:

- [**Adapty Paywall Builder**](adapty-paywall-builder.md): You create paywalls in Adapty's no-code builder, and the SDK renders them automatically.
- [**Manually created paywalls**](react-native-making-purchases.md): You build your own paywall UI in code but still use Adapty to fetch products and handle purchases.
- [**Observer mode**](observer-vs-full-mode.md): You keep your existing purchase infrastructure and use Adapty only for analytics and integrations.

Not sure which one to pick? Read the [comparison table in the quickstart](react-native-quickstart-paywalls.md).

### Install and configure the SDK

Add the Adapty SDK dependency using npm (or yarn) and activate it with your Public SDK key. This is the foundation — nothing else works without it.

We have separate installation guides for Expo and bare React Native projects — pick the one that matches your setup.

**Guides:**
- [Install with Expo](sdk-installation-react-native-expo.md)
- [Install with bare React Native](sdk-installation-react-native-pure.md)

Send this to your LLM (pick the one that matches your setup, or send both):
```
Read these Adapty docs before writing code:
- https://adapty.io/docs/sdk-installation-react-native-expo.md
- https://adapty.io/docs/sdk-installation-react-native-pure.md
```

:::tip[Checkpoint]
- **Expected:** App builds and runs on both iOS and Android. Metro bundler logs show Adapty activation log.
- **Gotcha:** "Public API key is missing" → check you replaced the placeholder with your real key from App settings.
:::

### Show paywalls and handle purchases

Fetch a paywall by placement ID, display it, and handle purchase events. The guides you need depend on how you handle purchases.

Test each purchase in the sandbox as you go — don't wait until the end. See [Test purchases in sandbox](test-purchases-in-sandbox.md) for setup instructions.

### Check subscription status

After a purchase, check the user profile for an active access level to gate premium content.

**Guide:** [Check subscription status](react-native-check-subscription-status.md)

Send this to your LLM:
```
Read these Adapty docs before writing code:
- https://adapty.io/docs/react-native-check-subscription-status.md
```

:::tip[Checkpoint]
- **Expected:** After a sandbox purchase, `profile.accessLevels['premium']?.isActive` returns `true`.
- **Gotcha:** Empty `accessLevels` after purchase → check the product has an access level assigned in the dashboard.
:::

### Identify users

Link your app user accounts to Adapty profiles so purchases persist across devices.

:::important
Skip this step if your app has no authentication.
:::

**Guide:** [Identify users](react-native-quickstart-identify.md)

Send this to your LLM:
```
Read these Adapty docs before writing code:
- https://adapty.io/docs/react-native-quickstart-identify.md
```

:::tip[Checkpoint]
- **Expected:** After calling `adapty.identify("your-user-id")`, the dashboard **Profiles** section shows your custom user ID.
- **Gotcha:** Call `identify` after activation but before fetching paywalls to avoid anonymous profile attribution.
:::

### Prepare for release

Once your integration works in the sandbox, walk through the release checklist to make sure everything is production-ready.

**Guide:** [Release checklist](release-checklist.md)

Send this to your LLM:
```
Read these Adapty docs before releasing:
- https://adapty.io/docs/release-checklist.md
```

:::tip[Checkpoint]
- **Expected:** All checklist items confirmed: store connections, server notifications, purchase flow, access level checks, and privacy requirements.
- **Gotcha:** Missing server notifications → configure App Store Server Notifications in **App settings → iOS SDK** and Google Play Real-Time Developer Notifications in **App settings → Android SDK**.

## Best practices for AI tools

This section covers how to set up your LLM or AI code editor for the best results with Adapty documentation.

### Use plain text docs

You can access any Adapty doc as plain text Markdown by adding `.md` to the end of its URL or clicking **Copy for LLM** under the article title. For example: [https://adapty.io/docs/adapty-cursor-react-native.md](https://adapty.io/docs/adapty-cursor-react-native.md).

The most practical approach is to send your LLM the `.md` link for the specific page you need — this keeps token usage low and gives the LLM focused context. The "Send this to your LLM" blocks in each stage above do exactly this.

If you need broader context, we also host index files:

- [`llms.txt`](https://adapty.io/docs/llms.txt): An [emerging standard](https://llmstxt.org/) for making websites accessible to LLMs. Lists all pages with `.md` links. Note that for some AI agents (e.g., ChatGPT) you will need to download `llms.txt` and upload it to the chat as a file.
- [`llms-full.txt`](https://adapty.io/docs/llms-full.txt): The entire Adapty documentation site combined into a single file. Very large — use only when you need the full picture.
- React Native-specific [`react-native-llms.txt`](https://adapty.io/docs/react-native-llms.txt) and [`react-native-llms-full.txt`](https://adapty.io/docs/react-native-llms-full.txt): Platform-specific subsets that save tokens compared to the full site.

### Use with Cursor

**Cursor**, the AI code editor, makes it easier to integrate and maintain apps with Adapty's infrastructure. This section shows you how to configure Cursor for better results when working with Adapty's SDK.

#### Add Adapty documentation to Cursor

Adding Adapty's documentation directly to Cursor means you don't have to switch between your code editor and browser. This setup gives you quick access to the latest implementation guides and best practices while coding.

To add Adapty documentation to Cursor:

1. In Cursor, go to **Settings > Cursor settings**. Switch to **Indexing & Docs**.
2. Click **Add doc**.
3. Enter the URL `https://adapty.io/docs`.
4. Name the documentation `Adapty Docs` and click **Confirm** to save it.

    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

#### Add Adapty SDKs to Cursor

For platform-specific development, we recommend adding the GitHub repository for the Adapty React Native SDK. This gives you access to the latest code examples, changelogs, and implementation details.

Follow the same process as above, but use the SDK repository URL:

- **React Native SDK**: `https://github.com/adaptyteam/AdaptySDK-React-Native`

Name the doc `Adapty React Native SDK`.

### Reference Adapty in your prompts

Once configured, you can reference Adapty documentation and SDKs using the `@` symbol in Cursor prompts. This makes sure Cursor uses current and accurate information when generating code.

**Example prompts:**

- `@Adapty Docs help me install the Adapty SDK`
- `@Adapty React Native SDK show me how to handle purchase restoration with proper error handling`
- `@Adapty Docs @Adapty React Native SDK help me show a paywall created in the paywall builder`
