The Adapty CLI lets you set up your app configuration entirely from the command line. Use it as an alternative to the [dashboard quickstart](integrate-payments) if you prefer terminal tooling or MCP clients.

:::note
Connecting Adapty to App Store Connect and Google Play still requires a one-time setup in the dashboard — covered in step 3.
:::

By the end, your app, access level, product, paywall, and placement are all visible in the [Adapty dashboard](https://app.adapty.io).

## 1. Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @adapty/cli
```

## 2. Authenticate

Run the login command to connect the CLI to your Adapty account.

```bash
adapty auth login
```

The CLI opens a browser tab. Match the code shown in the terminal to the code shown in the browser, then click **Authorize**. The terminal confirms when authentication is complete.

## 3. Create your app

An app in Adapty represents your mobile application. One Adapty app connects to both App Store and Google Play — you only need to create one, regardless of how many stores you publish to.

```bash
adapty app create --title "My App" --apple-bundle-id com.example.app
```

The command returns an `<app-id>`. Use this ID in all subsequent commands.

:::important
Before continuing, connect your app to App Store Connect and Google Play in the Adapty dashboard. Product IDs from both stores are required in step 5.

- [Connect App Store Connect](app-store-connection-configuration)
- [Connect Google Play](google-play-store-connection-configuration)
:::

## 4. Create an access level (optional)

[Access levels](access-level) control what users can access after purchase. Instead of checking whether a user bought a specific product, your app checks whether the user has a given access level. This decouples your app logic from specific product IDs.

A `premium` access level is automatically created with every new app. **For most apps, you can skip this step.** Use `premium` as the access level ID in step 5.

Only run this command if different products unlock different features for different user groups — for example, if a "Basic" subscriber and a "Pro" subscriber get access to different parts of the app.

```bash
adapty access-level create --app <app-id> --title "Pro"
```

The command returns an `<access-level-id>`.

## 5. Create a product

In Adapty, a [product](product) represents anything your app sells — a subscription or a one-time purchase. Items from App Store Connect and Google Play can be grouped into a single Adapty product and managed from one place.

```bash
adapty product create --app <app-id> --access-level <access-level-id> --apple-product-id <your.apple.id> --google-product-id <your.google.id>
```

The command returns a `<product-id>`.

## 6. Create a paywall

A [paywall](paywalls) is the container that holds your products. In Adapty, paywalls are the only way to deliver products to users. Every product must be in a paywall before it can appear in your app.

```bash
adapty paywall create --app <app-id> --product-ids <product-id>
```

The command returns a `<paywall-id>`.

## 7. Create a placement

A [placement](placements) is the point in your app where you show a paywall. The only thing you hardcode in your app code is the placement ID. Everything else — which paywall to show and to which users — is managed in the dashboard without releasing a new app version.

Set `--developer-id` to the identifier your app uses to fetch this paywall via the Adapty SDK.

```bash
adapty placement create --app <app-id> --paywall-id <paywall-id> --developer-id "main"
```

## What's next

All entities are now visible in the [Adapty dashboard](https://app.adapty.io). Next:

- [Design your paywall](adapty-paywall-builder) — use the no-code Paywall Builder to add visuals, layout, and copy to the paywall you just created.
- [Integrate the Adapty SDK](quickstart-sdk) — add the SDK to your app to fetch and display the placement.
