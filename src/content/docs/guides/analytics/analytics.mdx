Adapty Analytics is a powerful suite of tools for data visualization and analysis. Built for application development teams, it focuses on your app's financial performance and user behavior.

In addition to standard metrics available in your store analytics (such as revenue or installations), Adapty calculates compound metrics: user lifetime value, cohort analysis, and more. Dedicated sections analyze user behavior that leads to revenue loss: retention graphs, billing issue resolution data. Browse the charts to gain insight into user behavior, and optimize your application with data-driven decisions.

Read the [How Adapty Analytics Works](how-adapty-analytics-works) guide to learn more about how data is sourced and processed.
