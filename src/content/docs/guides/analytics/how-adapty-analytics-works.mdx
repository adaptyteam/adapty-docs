## Data and its sources

Adapty Analytics processes the following data into [charts and graphs](analytics):

- [Subscription events](events) such as <InlineTooltip tooltip="purchases and cancellations">Open the [event feed](event-feed) to see your users' subscription events in real time.</InlineTooltip>. 
- [Transaction data](revenue) — revenue, refunds, the buyer's country, etc.
- **Application data** such as the number of installations or [paywall interactions](paywalls).
- [Attribution data for transactions](attribution-integration): traffic sources and ad campaigns.
 
This data comes from the following sources:

- The  <InlineTooltip tooltip="Adapty SDK">[iOS](sdk-installation-ios), [Android](sdk-installation-android), [React Native](sdk-installation-reactnative), [Flutter](sdk-installation-flutter), and [Unity](sdk-installation-unity)</InlineTooltip> provides user behavior data.
- The <InlineTooltip tooltip="app stores">[Apple App Store](enable-app-store-server-notifications), [Google Play Store](enable-real-time-developer-notifications-rtdn)</InlineTooltip> use server-to-server communication to notify Adapty of transactions (trials, subscription renewals, cancellations, etc.).
- Third-party [attribution services](attribution-integration) (Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch, etc.) share data on traffic sources and ad campaigns.
- Users can [manually import transaction data](importing-historical-data-to-adapty) for Adapty to analyze and display.

A problem with one of the sources may impact the quality of your analytics data as a whole. View the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for more information.

## Third party integrations

You can enable [Adapty User Acquisition](adapty-user-acquisition) to leverage data from third-party marketing platforms, and expand Adapty's analytics capabilities. The User Acquisition view allows you to explore the relationship between ad campaigns and user behavior.

Likewise, you can [export](analytics-integration) analytics data to third-party platforms or a [private server](webhook), and analyze data from Adapty on a different platform.

## Differences between Adapty Analytics and store analytics

- **Data variety**

        Stores can only display first-party data.

        Adapty can combine data from multiple stores, as well as additional sources — marketing platforms and ad networks.

- **Update frequency**

        App stores usually updates their data once a day, which can limit your ability to make real-time decisions.

        Adapty offers close to real-time analytics that allow you to accurately track key performance metrics as they change. For most sources, the processing delay is only 15 to 30 minutes long.

- **Advanced metrics**
        
        App stores display basic metrics such as downloads, revenue, and retention rates. 
        
        In addition to basic metrics, Adapty calculates advanced metrics (recurring revenue, average revenue per user, etc.), and has dedicated analysis functions for unwanted user behavior (churn, billing issues).

- **Data depth**

        Stores do not have access to user behavior metrics. 

        Adapty uses the SDK to analyze user interactions with paywalls and onboardings.


- **Predictions**

        Adapty uses advanced machine learning algorithms to [predict future LTV and revenue](predicted-ltv-and-revenue).
    
## Troubleshooting

Main article: [Discrepancies and Troubleshooting](discrepancies-and-troubleshooting)
:::

* A misconfigured or missing data source can negatively affect the entire analytics system. If you encounter data issues, make sure your integrations with stores and third-party platforms are properly set up. 

* If you compare Adapty charts to other analytics platforms, you may notice discrepancies. This is not necessarily bad and may result from differences in data processing. Read the [discrepancies guide](discrepancies-and-troubleshooting) article to learn about common causes of data discrepancies.
