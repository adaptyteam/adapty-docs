This article describes how Adapty Analytics works: what data it displays, where the data is from, and how the data is processed. It also explains the design decisions that make Adapty Analytics different, and how these decisions benefit you.

## Differences between Adapty Analytics and store analytics

- **Data variety**: Stores can only display their own data, and cannot access user behavior inside the app.

        Adapty can combine data from multiple stores, as well as additional sources — marketing platforms and ad networks. The Adapty SDK tracks user interactions with paywalls and onboardings.

- **Update frequency**: App stores usually update their data once a day, which can limit your ability to make real-time decisions.

        Adapty offers [close to real-time](#data-processing) analytics.

- **Advanced metrics**: App stores display basic metrics such as downloads, revenue, and retention rates. 
        
        Adapty also calculates advanced metrics, such as recurring revenue or average revenue per user. Dedicated sections analyze subscription issues: user churn, billing failures, etc.

- **Predictions**: Adapty uses advanced machine learning algorithms to [predict future LTV and revenue](predicted-ltv-and-revenue).
    

## Data and its sources

Adapty Analytics processes the following data into [charts and graphs](analytics):

- [Subscription events](events) such as <InlineTooltip tooltip="purchases and cancellations"> Open the [event feed](event-feed) to see your users' subscription events in real time.</InlineTooltip>. 
- [Transaction data](revenue) — revenue, refunds, the buyer's country, etc.
- **Application data** such as the number of installations or [paywall interactions](paywalls).
- [Attribution data for transactions](attribution-integration): traffic sources and ad campaigns.
 
This data comes from the following sources:

- The <InlineTooltip tooltip="Adapty SDK">[iOS](ios-sdk-overview), [Android](android-sdk-overview), [React Native](reactnative-sdk-overview), [Flutter](flutter-sdk-overview), [Unity](unity-sdk-overview), [Kotlin Multiplatform](kmp-sdk-overview), [Capacitor](capacitor-sdk-overview) </InlineTooltip> reports user behavior data from inside the app. If Adapty handles your purchase flow management, the SDK shares first-hand information about the purchase events. If you use the [observer mode](observer-vs-full-mode), the SDK receives [event reports](report-transactions-observer-mode) that you set up manually.
- The stores use server-to-server communication to notify Adapty of transactions (trials, subscription renewals, cancellations, etc.).
- Third-party [attribution services](attribution-integration) (Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch, etc.) share data on traffic sources and ad campaigns. If you set up [Adapty User Acquisition](adapty-user-acquisition), Adapty can handle your ad campaign data on its own, bypassing this step.
- Users can [manually import historical transaction data](importing-historical-data-to-adapty) for Adapty to analyze and display.

A problem with one of the sources may impact the overall quality of your analytics data. View the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for more information.

## Third-party integrations

You can enable [Adapty User Acquisition](adapty-user-acquisition) to expand Adapty's analytics capabilities with ad campaign data. It will help you discover correlations between ad campaign spending and user behavior.

Likewise, you can [export](analytics-integration) analytics data to third-party platforms or a [private server](webhook), and analyze data from Adapty on a different platform.

## Data processing

Adapty offers close to real-time analytics, which allows users to quickly react to changes in key metrics. 

- For store events, the processing delay is 15 to 30 minutes long. 
- Data from third-party sources updates in near real time. The exact delay depends on the platform and infrastructure conditions.

## Tax and commission logic

When you view revenue-related charts, Adapty gives you the option to choose between **Gross revenue**, **Revenue after commissions**, and **Revenue after commissions and taxes**. 

Adapty retrieves applicable commission and tax rates directly from the stores. The stores report whether the transaction is subject to any of the following exceptions:

* [App Store Small Business Program](app-store-small-business-program) — 15% commission
* Google's [reduced service fee program](google-reduced-service-fee)
* [Renewals for 1+ year long App Store subscriptions](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions/) — 15% commission
* Country-specific rates (for example, [21% for App Store apps distributed in Japan](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-distribution-in-japan/#business-terms))

Main article: [Discrepancies and Troubleshooting](discrepancies-and-troubleshooting)
:::

* A misconfigured or missing data source can negatively affect the entire analytics system. If you encounter data issues, make sure your integrations with stores and third-party platforms are configured and active. 

* If you compare Adapty charts to other analytics platforms, you may notice discrepancies. This is expected behavior that may result from differences in data processing. Read the [discrepancies guide](discrepancies-and-troubleshooting) article to learn about common causes of data discrepancies.
