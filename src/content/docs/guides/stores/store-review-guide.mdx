This article walks you through the process that [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) and [Google](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859455?hl=en) follow when reviewing app submissions. It offers tips to speed up your app's approval, with a particular focus on paywalls and in-app purchases.

## Before you begin

Make sure your application is eligible for submission. Google Play Store requires first-time publishers to [test the app](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14151465?hl=en) before submitting it. The test should involve at least 12 people, and last a minimum of 14 consecutive days. 

This requirement was introduced in 2025 to make sure that unexperienced developers fix major bugs before their app reaches Google staff.

## Step 1: The automated screening

Both App Store and Google Play Store follow a similar two-step review process. Immediately after the submission, your app undergoes an automated scan that may take up to several hours.

Both stores scan your app for malware, with Google putting a particular emphasis on this process. Its AI looks for indirect signs of malicious activity, like contact with suspicious servers, unjustified access to user data, and other behavioral signals. If your application is deemed potentially harmful, it is flagged and passed to a human security analyst. The [Google Play Protect documentation](https://developers.google.com/android/play-protect/cloud-based-protections#machine-learning) contains an approximate list of checks performed during this step.

The stores also confirm the presence of necessary metadata, lack of harmful or severely outdated dependencies, and the integrity of your build.

## Step 2: The human review

After your app passes the automated screening, it is examined by a human reviewer. This step may take up to several days, depending on the complexity of your app and the current review queue. Apps that process sensitive data take longer to review.

Even during this step, Google relies heavily on automation: 92% of its submission reviews are [AI-assisted](https://security.googleblog.com/2025/01/how-we-kept-google-play-android-app-ecosystem-safe-2024.html). User reports across the web indicate that this aspect negatively impacts the consistency of Google's reviews.

## General requirements

### Stability

Applications that crash during review are rejected. Reviewers may intentionally simulate unreliable network conditions, so the app must be able to handle them well.

### Completeness

Both Apple and Google impose a *completeness* ("minimum functionality") requirement on store content.

* Placeholders, "coming soon" screens, and broken capabilities lead to rejections for iOS apps.
* Google is [more flexible](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9898783?hl=en), particularly if your application is in [Early Access](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13515709?hl=en).
* Both stores **do not accept apps** with limited to no functionality. If your application displays a single image, PDF file, or web page, expect a rejection.

Missing content falls into the same category.

* If the app does not accomplish what you advertise, it will be rejected.
* If you configure an in-app purchase in your dashboard, but do not include it in the build, the app will be rejected.

### Metadata accuracy

Misleading, inaccurate, or inconsistent information in description, screenshots, and other metadata may lead to rejection.

Do not use your App Store listing to advertise future app capabilities.

If a part of your application is not intuitive to the general public, include clear instructions and explanations in the app's metadata and documentation.

### Legal aspects

* Your app's privacy policy should be accessible from inside the app. 
* Ensure that your users read and accept any legal agreements **before** they come into force.
* You should not hide the fact that your application includes advertisements. Failure to disclose ads may result in a rejection.
* If your iOS app includes in-app purchases, you need to accept the **Paid Apps Agreement** in your App Store Connect dashboard.

### Authentication

If a part of your app's content is only available after authentication, provide valid access credentials for the store reviewer. Inability to access content in full warrants a rejection.

If your app allows users to create an account, it should also allow them to delete it. Directing users to email-based support or a website does not satisfy this requirement.

### Access and privacy

The app's metadata needs to clearly state the reason for each requested permission. The most sensitive of permissions (for example, access to text messages and call logs) may require a video demonstration.

The same principle applies to sensitive user data: if you request it, explain why.

## IAP-related requirements
 
According to Apple's 2024 Transparency Report, business policy violations are [among the most common reasons](https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/docs/2024-App-Store-Transparency-Report.pdf) for app rejections. If the primary monetization methods for your application are subscriptions and in-app purchases, it will face increased scrutiny.

### Appropriate payment methods

Both stores prohibit the sale of physical goods with in-app purchases, and require in-store billing for most digital goods.

Members of the European Economic Area, South Korea, and the US are the main exceptions to the rule:

    * South Korea was [the first country](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3147057/south-korea-bans-app-payment-monopolies-apple-google-world) to mandate alternative billing in 2021.
    * The EEA [Digital Markets Act](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/the-digital-markets-acts-impacts-on-eu-users/) became applicable in 2023.
    * The Epic Games' court wins against [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_v._Apple) and [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_v._Google) impact US-based apps.

Note that both stores enforce guidelines for third-party payment provider integration, and continue to charge a commission for purchases made through third-party payment systems.

Some products (such as e-books) may be eligible for alternative payment methods even outside these regions. Check the stores' official guidelines for details.

### Paywall requirements

App reviewers expect straightforward, easy to understand paywalls.

If you are suspected of user manipulation, the app is rejected. If several reviews find evidence of deceptive practices, your account can be disactivated, and your app [suspended](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/community-guide/287283557/app-suspended-for-repeated-rejections?hl=en). Google Play uses a [strike system](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9899234?hl=en) that can lead to all your apps being deleted.

Adhere to the following practices in your paywall design:

- **Be transparent and upfront.** 

    Display the products' exact price, billing frequency, benefits, and cancellation conditions before prompting the user to purchase.
    
    Clearly differentiate between one-time purchases and products that require recurring payments. 
    
    If a product comes with a free trial, make sure the user is aware of its duration and conditions.

    Do not use intentionally confusing language to mislead the user.

- **Be consistent.** 

    Product prices must match across App Store listing, in-app screens, subscription management screens, and marketing content. Any pricing mismatch, no matter how small, is grounds for rejection.

- **Display all tiers equally.** 

    Do not pre-select the most expensive option, nor hide the cheaper ones.

- **Avoid "dark patterns".** 

    Do not create a false sense of urgency or scarcity with fake countdown timers and stock counters. 
    
    Do not force users to make purchases by intentionally making free capabilities inconvenient or hard to locate. Make sure that the user can skip or close your paywalls.

### Access guarantee

The application needs to guarantee the users' right to access their purchases.

* **Immediate access** 

    A successful purchase should immediately unlock access to the product, without visible delays. 
    
    The intermediate states of payment authorization should be gracefully handled.

    A successful purchase should immediately get rid of the paywall. If you display the paywall after a purchase, you prevent the user from accessing what they already paid for. 

* **Purchase restoration**

    A user should be able to restore access to the product from a new device. 

    The app should be able to recognize purchases made in the app store (e.g. from the product page).

## Continuous monitoring

Both app stores continue to monitor your application even after it passes the review process. 

If your app's behavior or function changes after approval (for example, due to execution of remote code), it will be flagged and unlisted. Sudden influx of negative user feedback is also grounds for additional scrutiny.

Between 2024 and 2025, Google [removed 47% of its Play Store apps](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/google-play-sees-47-decline-in-apps-since-start-of-last-year/) in an attempt to increase their average quality.

Abandoning your app also carries a risk — both [Google](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-play-store-will-hide-apps-that-havent-been-updated-in-years/) and [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store-improvements/#:~:text=Developers%20of%20apps%20that%20have,launch%20will%20be%20removed%20immediately.) reserve the right to delist apps that do not receive updates or downloads.

## Handle rejection

If your application gets rejected, there often is a good reason. Reviewers typically cite which guideline(s) your app violated. Treat the rejection as an extra round of feedback from an experienced QA. Recreate the issue and fix it.

If you feel that the rejection was unfair, you have the right to appeal it. Provide evidence of compliance and reach out to the store. 

* Do not update the app while it's being reviewed.
* Subsequent reviews typically take less time than the first one.
* Every time you submit your application for review, you may get a different reviewer. This can work in your favor, or against you.
* Expedited review may be available for critical bugs and deadlines — use sparingly.
* Do not fix issues one by one, submit the app for re-review when you're done.
* If Google Play rejected your application for policy violations, update the data in question across all the tracks, even if they're paused or inactive.
