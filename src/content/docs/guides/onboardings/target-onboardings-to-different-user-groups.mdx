This guide describes how to implement attribute-driven onboardings in your app. Instead of presenting a single static sequence to all users, the onboarding displayed can vary based on predefined attributes such as acquisition source, campaign, geography, device type, lifecycle state, or user intent.

## Step 1. Identify users and assign custom attributes

1. To assign custom attributes to your user, you need to refer to them either by profile ID or customer user ID. So, after you activate the Adapty SDK, call the `getProfile` method of the Adapty SDK. You will need the `profileId` property.

2. Now, in your app, you need to use the user data you have to [assign it as a custom attribute to them or to update an existing attribute](api-adapty/operations/updateProfile) using the server-side API. For example, if you want to use the campaign type, you can update the user profile with something like:

```
"custom_attributes": [
    [
      "key": "campaign",
      "value": "yoga"
    ]
  ]
```

## Step 2. Add users to segments

Now, group all the users with the attributes assigned into [segments](segments):

1. In the dashboard, go to **Profiles & Segments** and switch to the **Segments** tab. There, click **Create segment**.
2. Click **Add users attributes** and select an attribute from the list.
3. Create one segment per each attribute you are going to use as a deciding factor.

:::note
For a custom attribute to appear in the list, it must be assigned to at least one profile. You can do it via curl or just add a custom attribute to any profile from the dashboard, so it can be used.

## Step 3. Set up placement

For Adapty to decide which onboarding to display, you
