import ZoomImage from '@site/src/components/ZoomImage';

Whenever you **Save**, **Preview**, or **Publish** your onboarding, Adapty adds the current version to your **version history**. You can browse the version history and switch to any of the saved versions.

:::warning
Adapty doesn't autosave your onboardings during the [editing process](design-onboarding). **Publish** your onboarding if you want to add it to your version history.
:::

Open the "versions" menu in the top right corner of the page to view your version history. Each version contains a timestamp to let you know when it was saved. Click the arrows button on one of the entries to revert to this state.

:::important
Remember to **publish** the changes after you revert to an earlier version.
