Adapty creates an internal profile ID for every user. However, if you have your own authentication system, you should set your own Customer User ID. You can find users by their Customer User ID in the [Profiles](profiles-crm) section and use it in the [server-side API](getting-started-with-server-side-api), which will be sent to all integrations.

### Setting customer user ID on configuration

If you have a user ID during configuration, just pass it as `customerUserId` parameter to `.activate()` method:

```kotlin showLineNumbers
import com.adapty.kmp.Adapty
import com.adapty.kmp.models.AdaptyConfig

Adapty.activate(
    AdaptyConfig.Builder("PUBLIC_SDK_KEY")
        .withCustomerUserId("YOUR_USER_ID")
        .build()
).onSuccess {
    // successful activation
}.onError { error ->
    // handle the error
    }
}
```

<SampleApp />

### Setting customer user ID after configuration

If you don't have a user ID in the SDK configuration, you can set it later at any time with the `.identify()` method. The most common cases for using this method are after registration or authorization, when the user switches from being an anonymous user to an authenticated user.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
import com.adapty.kmp.Adapty

Adapty.identify("YOUR_USER_ID").onSuccess {
    // successful identify
}.onError { error ->
    // handle the error
}
```

Request parameters:

- **Customer User ID** (required): a string user identifier.

:::warning
Resubmitting of significant user data

In some cases, such as when a user logs into their account again, Adapty's servers already have information about that user. In these scenarios, the Adapty SDK will automatically switch to work with the new user. If you passed any data to the anonymous user, such as custom attributes or attributions from third-party networks, you should resubmit that data for the identified user.

It's also important to note that you should re-request all paywalls and products after identifying the user, as the new user's data may be different.
:::

### Logging out and logging in

You can log the user out anytime by calling `.logout()` method:

```kotlin showLineNumbers
import com.adapty.kmp.Adapty

Adapty.logout().onSuccess {
    // successful logout
}.onError { error ->
    // handle the error
}
```

You can then login the user using `.identify()` method.

## Assign `appAccountToken` (iOS)

[`iosAppAccountToken`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/purchaseoption/appaccounttoken(_:)) is a **UUID** that lets you link App Store transactions to your internal user identity.
StoreKit associates this token with every transaction, so your backend can match App Store data to your users.

Use a stable UUID generated per user and reuse it for the same account across devices.
This ensures that purchases and App Store notifications stay correctly linked.

You can set the token in two ways – during the SDK activation or when identifying the user.

:::important
You must always pass `iosAppAccountToken` together with `customerUserId`.
If you pass only the token, it will not be included in the transaction.
:::

```kotlin showLineNumbers
import com.adapty.kmp.Adapty
import com.adapty.kmp.models.AdaptyConfig

// During configuration:
Adapty.activate(
    AdaptyConfig.Builder("PUBLIC_SDK_KEY")
        .withCustomerUserId(
            id = "YOUR_USER_ID",
            iosAppAccountToken = "YOUR_IOS_APP_ACCOUNT_TOKEN"
        )
        .build()
).onSuccess {
    // successful activation
}.onError { error ->
    // handle the error
}

// Or when identifying users
Adapty.identify(
    customerUserId = "YOUR_USER_ID",
    iosAppAccountToken = "YOUR_IOS_APP_ACCOUNT_TOKEN"
).onSuccess {
    // successful identify
}.onError { error ->
    // handle the error
}
```

## Set obfuscated account IDs (Android)

Google Play requires obfuscated account IDs for certain use cases to enhance user privacy and security. These IDs help Google Play identify purchases while keeping user information anonymous, which is particularly important for fraud prevention and analytics.

You may need to set these IDs if your app handles sensitive user data or if you're required to comply with specific privacy regulations. The obfuscated IDs allow Google Play to track purchases without exposing actual user identifiers.

:::important
You must always pass `androidObfuscatedAccountId` together with `customerUserId`.
If you pass only the obfuscated account ID, it will not be included in the transaction.
:::

```kotlin showLineNumbers
import com.adapty.kmp.Adapty
import com.adapty.kmp.models.AdaptyConfig

// During configuration:
Adapty.activate(
    AdaptyConfig.Builder("PUBLIC_SDK_KEY")
        .withCustomerUserId(
            id = "YOUR_USER_ID",
            androidObfuscatedAccountId = "YOUR_OBFUSCATED_ACCOUNT_ID"
        )
        .build()
).onSuccess {
    // successful activation
}.onError { error ->
    // handle the error
}

// Or when identifying users
Adapty.identify(
    customerUserId = "YOUR_USER_ID",
    androidObfuscatedAccountId = "YOUR_OBFUSCATED_ACCOUNT_ID"
).onSuccess {
    // successful identify
}.onError { error ->
    // handle the error
}
```
