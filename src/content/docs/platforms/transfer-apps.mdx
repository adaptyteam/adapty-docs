Transfer your app to a different owner when your company is acquired, you're selling your app, or reorganizing business entities. The transfer process involves coordinating changes in Adapty, App Store Connect, and Google Play Console to ensure continuous service.

## Transfer app ownership

Complete the store transfer first, then transfer the app in Adapty. This order ensures purchases continue working throughout the transition.

:::note
Do not delete or recreate products during the transfer process. Do not change product IDs until after verifying the transfer completed successfully.
:::

### App Store (iOS) transfer

:::important
App Store Connect API keys (Issuer ID, Key ID, .p8 file) are account-scoped, not app-scoped. After transfer, you must generate new API keys from the new owner's account and update them in Adapty.
:::

1. **New owner:** Create an Adapty account at [app.adapty.io](https://app.adapty.io) if you don't have one.
2. **Old owner:** Initiate the app transfer in App Store Connect following Apple's [transfer guide](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/transfer-an-app/overview-of-app-transfer).
3. **New owner:** Accept the transfer in App Store Connect.
4. **Old owner:** Email [support@adapty.io](mailto:support@adapty.io) to transfer the app in Adapty. Provide the app name and new owner's email address.
5. **New owner:** After receiving the app in Adapty, complete the [App Store integration guide](initial_ios) to generate and configure all credentials under your account.

### Google Play (Android) transfer

1. **New owner:** Create an Adapty account at [app.adapty.io](https://app.adapty.io) if you don't have one.
2. **Both owners:** Ensure both Google Play Developer accounts are fully registered.
3. **Old owner:** Submit a transfer request via Google Play Console or Google Play Developer Support. Google may request additional documents such as DUNS numbers, contracts, or proof of sale.
4. **New owner:** Review and approve the transfer request.
5. **Google:** Google support team processes the transfer, typically within a few business days, but may take longer depending on account verification, subscription complexity, and payment setup.
6. **Old owner:** After Google completes the transfer, email [support@adapty.io](mailto:support@adapty.io) to transfer the app in Adapty. Provide the app name and new owner's email address.
7. **New owner:** After receiving the app in Adapty, complete the [Google Play integration guide](initial-android) to generate and configure all credentials under your account.

The transfer includes users, subscriptions, statistics, ratings, and store listing. Billing continuity is maintained for existing subscribers, but payouts switch to the new owner's merchant account only after the transfer completes. Payout reports and orders before transfer remain in the original account. Follow Google's [transfer guide](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6230247) for detailed requirements.

## Risk mitigation and timing

**What continues working during transfer:**
- Purchases (app-specific shared secret validates receipts)
- Renewals (shared secret remains valid)
- Existing subscriber access
- SDK continues functioning

**What temporarily stops working:**
- App Store Connect API calls (until new keys configured)
- Server notifications (until endpoint reconfigured)
- Analytics may have gaps during credential transition

**Recommended timing:**
- Complete transfers during low-traffic periods (3am-6am in your primary user timezone)
- Have new owner ready to configure credentials immediately after accepting store transfer
- Budget 15-30 minutes between accepting transfer and completing Adapty integration

**After completing transfer:**
- Test receipt validation immediately
- Monitor auto-renewal success rates for 48 hours
- Verify server notifications are reaching your systems
- Check that new purchases are being tracked correctly

## Verify transfer completed successfully

After completing both the Adapty and store transfers:

1. **Check Dashboard access**: New owner should see the app in their Adapty Dashboard.
2. **Verify API key connection**: Check that the new App Store Connect API Key or Google Play service account connects successfully in Adapty.
3. **Test SDK connection**: Run your app and verify Adapty SDK initializes without errors.
