Transfer your app to a different owner when your company is acquired, you're selling your app, or reorganizing business entities. The transfer process involves coordinating changes in Adapty, App Store Connect, and Google Play Console to ensure continuous service.

## Change app owner in Adapty

Contact Adapty support to transfer apps between Adapty accounts. Adapty transfers apps individually. If you have multiple apps in your account, specify which ones to transfer. Other apps remain in your original account.

**Before requesting a transfer:**

The new owner must have an Adapty account. If they don't have an account, they should create one first at [app.adapty.io](https://app.adapty.io).

**To request a transfer:**

1. Email [support@adapty.io](mailto:support@adapty.io).
2. Specify which apps to transfer.
3. Provide the email address of the new owner.

**User impact:** The Adapty transfer happens quickly. Existing subscribers maintain access and your SDK continues working during this step.

## Complete transfer in App Store Connect or Google Play

After Adapty transfers the app, complete the ownership transfer in your store.

### App Store transfer process

For apps with subscriptions, coordinate the shared secret before initiating the transfer:

1. **Old owner:** Generate an app-specific shared secret in App Store Connect and share it with the new owner.
2. **New owner:** Update the shared secret in [Adapty Dashboard](app-store-connection-configuration) before accepting the transfer.
3. **Old owner:** Initiate the app transfer in App Store Connect following Apple's [transfer guide](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/transfer-an-app/overview-of-app-transfer).
4. **New owner:** Accept the transfer in App Store Connect.
5. **New owner:** After transfer completes, generate a new app-specific shared secret and update it in Adapty Dashboard. This revokes the old owner's access.

### Google Play transfer process

Google Play transfers apps through a support-managed process:

1. **Both owners:** Ensure both Google Play Developer accounts are fully registered.
2. **Old owner:** In Google Play Console, go to **Settings** > **Transfer Apps** and complete the transfer request form.
3. **New owner:** Review and approve the transfer request.
4. **Google:** Google support team processes the transfer within 2 business days.

The transfer includes users, subscriptions, statistics, ratings, and store listing. Payout reports and orders before transfer remain in the original account. Follow Google's [transfer guide](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6230247) for detailed requirements.

### Update additional settings after transfer

Your app's Bundle ID (iOS) and Package Name (Android) stay the same during transfer. This is an Apple and Google requirement. Your products and SDK integration remain linked to the app automatically.

**For iOS apps:**

1. **App Store Connect API Key**: Generate a new key from the new owner's App Store Connect account and [update it in Adapty](app-store-connection-configuration#step-6-add-app-store-connect-api-key).
2. **App Store server notifications**: [Reconfigure server notifications](enable-app-store-server-notifications) with the new owner's credentials.

**For Android apps:**

1. **Google Play service account**: After transfer completes, [create a new service account](initial-android#step-2-create-a-service-account) under the new owner's Google Play Console account and update it in Adapty.

After updating settings, check [iOS integration settings](initial_ios) or [Android integration settings](initial-android) to verify all configurations point to the new owner's accounts.

## Verify transfer completed successfully

After completing both the Adapty and store transfers:

1. **Check Dashboard access**: New owner should see the app in their Adapty Dashboard.
2. **Verify API key connection**: Check that the new App Store Connect API Key or Google Play service account connects successfully in Adapty.
3. **Test SDK connection**: Run your app and verify Adapty SDK initializes without errors.
