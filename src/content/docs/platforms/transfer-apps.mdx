Transfer your app to a different owner when your company is acquired, you're selling your app, or reorganizing business entities. The transfer process involves coordinating changes in Adapty, App Store Connect, and Google Play Console to ensure continuous service.

## Change app owner in Adapty

Contact Adapty support to transfer apps between Adapty accounts. Adapty transfers apps individually. If you have multiple apps in your account, specify which ones to transfer. Other apps remain in your original account.

**Before requesting a transfer:**

The new owner must have an Adapty account. If they don't have an account, they should create one first at [app.adapty.io](https://app.adapty.io).

**To request a transfer:**

1. Email [support@adapty.io](mailto:support@adapty.io).
2. Specify which apps to transfer.
3. Provide the email address of the new owner.

**User impact:** The Adapty transfer happens quickly. Existing subscribers maintain access and your SDK continues working during this step.

## Complete transfer in App Store Connect or Google Play

After Adapty transfers the app, complete the ownership transfer in your store.

### App Store transfer process

For apps with subscriptions, coordinate the app-specific shared secret before initiating the transfer. The shared secret belongs to the app (not the account) and remains valid after transfer until regenerated.

1. **Old owner:** Generate an app-specific shared secret in App Store Connect and share it with the new owner.
2. **New owner:** Update the shared secret in [Adapty Dashboard](app-store-connection-configuration) before accepting the transfer. This ensures Adapty can continue validating receipts immediately after Apple switches the app to the new account.
3. **Old owner:** Initiate the app transfer in App Store Connect following Apple's [transfer guide](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/transfer-an-app/overview-of-app-transfer).
4. **New owner:** Accept the transfer in App Store Connect.
5. **New owner (recommended):** After transfer completes, generate a new app-specific shared secret and update it in Adapty Dashboard. This invalidates the previous secret and revokes access for anyone who knew it, including the old owner.

**Important:** App Store Connect API keys (Issuer ID, Key ID, .p8 file) are account-scoped, not app-scoped. After transfer, you must generate new API keys from the new owner's account and update them in Adapty.

### Google Play transfer process

Google Play transfers apps through a support-managed process:

1. **Both owners:** Ensure both Google Play Developer accounts are fully registered.
2. **Old owner:** Submit a transfer request via Google Play Console or Google Play Developer Support. Google may request additional documents such as DUNS numbers, contracts, or proof of sale.
3. **New owner:** Review and approve the transfer request.
4. **Google:** Google support team processes the transfer, typically within a few business days, but may take longer depending on account verification, subscription complexity, and payment setup.

The transfer includes users, subscriptions, statistics, ratings, and store listing. Billing continuity is maintained for existing subscribers, but payouts switch to the new owner's merchant account only after the transfer completes. Payout reports and orders before transfer remain in the original account. Follow Google's [transfer guide](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6230247) for detailed requirements.

### Update additional settings after transfer

After the store transfer completes, the new owner must complete the App Store or Google Play integration in Adapty again. Your app's Bundle ID (iOS) and Package Name (Android) stay the same during transfer, so your existing subscription products with the same product IDs remain linked automatically. However, all owner-specific credentials must be reconfigured.

**Important:** Do not delete or recreate products during the transfer process. Do not change product IDs until Adapty is fully reconnected under the new owner.

Follow the complete integration guide for your platform:

- **iOS apps**: [App Store integration guide](initial_ios)
- **Android apps**: [Google Play integration guide](initial-android)

These guides cover all required settings including API keys, shared secrets, service accounts, and server notifications.

## Verify transfer completed successfully

After completing both the Adapty and store transfers:

1. **Check Dashboard access**: New owner should see the app in their Adapty Dashboard.
2. **Verify API key connection**: Check that the new App Store Connect API Key or Google Play service account connects successfully in Adapty.
3. **Test SDK connection**: Run your app and verify Adapty SDK initializes without errors.
