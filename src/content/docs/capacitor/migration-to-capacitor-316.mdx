Starting from Adapty SDK v.3.16.0, Capacitor 8 is required. If you need Capacitor 7, use Adapty SDK v.3.15.

To upgrade to Capacitor SDK v.3.16, ensure your project uses Capacitor 8. If you're still using Capacitor 7, you have two options:

1. **Upgrade to Capacitor 8**: Follow the [official Capacitor migration guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/updating/8-0) to update your project, then install Adapty SDK v.3.16.
2. **Stay on Adapty SDK v.3.15**: If upgrading to Capacitor 8 is not feasible, continue using Adapty SDK v.3.15, which supports Capacitor 7.
