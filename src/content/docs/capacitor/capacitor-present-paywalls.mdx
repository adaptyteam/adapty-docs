If you've customized a paywall using the Paywall Builder, you don't need to worry about rendering it in your mobile app code to display it to the user. Such a paywall contains both what should be shown within the paywall and how it should be shown.

:::warning
This guide is for **Paywall Builder paywalls** only. The process for presenting paywalls differs for remote config paywalls. For presenting **remote config paywalls**, see [Render paywall designed by remote config](present-remote-config-paywalls).
:::

To display a paywall, use the `view.present()` method on the `view` created by the [`createPaywallView`](capacitor-get-pb-paywalls#fetch-the-view-configuration-of-paywall-designed-using-paywall-builder) method. Each `view` can only be used once. If you need to display the paywall again, call `createPaywallView` one more to create a new `view` instance. 

:::warning

Reusing the same `view` without recreating it may result in an error.
:::

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { adapty, createPaywallView } from '@adapty/capacitor';

const view = await createPaywallView(paywall);

view.setEventHandlers({
  onUrlPress(url) {
    window.open(url, '_blank');
    return false; 
  },
});

try {
  await view.present();
} catch (error) {
  // handle the error
}
```

## Use developer-defined timer

To use developer-defined timers in your mobile app, use the `timerId`, in this example, `CUSTOM_TIMER_NY`, the **Timer ID** of the developer-defined timer you set in the Adapty dashboard. It ensures your app dynamically updates the timer with the correct value—like `13d 09h 03m 34s` (calculated as the timer's end time, such as New Year's Day, minus the current time).

```typescript showLineNumbers
const customTimers = { 'CUSTOM_TIMER_NY': new Date(2025, 0, 1) };

const view = await createPaywallView(paywall, { customTimers });
```

In this example, `CUSTOM_TIMER_NY` is the **Timer ID** of the developer-defined timer you set in the Adapty dashboard. The timer ensures your app dynamically updates the timer with the correct value—like `13d 09h 03m 34s` (calculated as the timer's end time, such as New Year's Day, minus the current time).

## Show dialog

Use this method instead of native alert dialogs when a paywall view is presented on Android. On Android, regular alerts appear behind the paywall view, which makes them invisible to users. This method ensures proper dialog presentation above the paywall on all platforms.

```typescript showLineNumbers title="Capacitor"
try {
  const action = await view.showDialog({
    title: 'Close paywall?',
    content: 'You will lose access to exclusive offers.',
    primaryActionTitle: 'Stay',
    secondaryActionTitle: 'Close',
  });
  
  if (action === 'secondary') {
    // User confirmed - close the paywall
    await view.dismiss();
  }
  // If primary - do nothing, user stays
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
}
```

## Configure iOS presentation style

Configure how the paywall is presented on iOS by passing the `iosPresentationStyle` parameter to the `present()` method. The parameter accepts `'full_screen'` (default) or `'page_sheet'` values.

```typescript showLineNumbers
await view.present({ iosPresentationStyle: 'page_sheet' });
```
