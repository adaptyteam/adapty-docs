If you've already implemented the Adapty SDK in your Unity app, you'll want to test that everything is set up correctly and that purchases work as expected across both iOS and Android platforms. This involves testing both the SDK integration and the actual purchase flow with Apple's sandbox environment and Google Play's testing environment.

## Test your app

For comprehensive testing of your in-app purchases, see our platform-specific testing guides: [iOS testing guide](test-purchases-in-sandbox.md) and [Android testing guide](testing-on-android.md).

## Prepare for release

Before submitting your app to the store, follow the [Release checklist](release-checklist) to confirm:

- Store connection and server notifications are configured
- Purchases complete and are reported to Adapty
- Access unlocks and restores correctly
- Privacy and review requirements are met
