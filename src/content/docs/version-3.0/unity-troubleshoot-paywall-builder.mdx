This guide helps you resolve common issues when using paywalls designed in the Adapty Paywall Builder in the Unity SDK.

## Getting a paywall configuration fails

**Issue**: The `CreateView` method fails to retrieve paywall configuration.

**Reason**: The paywall is not enabled for device display in the Paywall Builder.

**Solution**: Enable the **Show on device** toggle in the Paywall Builder.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/show-on-device.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

## The paywall view number is too big

**Issue**: The paywall view count is showing double the expected number.

**Reason**: You may be calling `LogShowPaywall` in your code, which duplicates the view count if you're using the Paywall builder. For paywalls designed with the Paywall Builder, analytics are tracked automatically, so you don't need to use this method.

**Solution**: Ensure you are not calling `LogShowPaywall` in your code if you're using the Paywall builder.

## Other issues

**Issue**: You're experiencing other Paywall Builder-related problems not covered above.

**Solution**: Migrate the SDK to the latest version using the [migration guides](unity-sdk-migration-guides) if needed. Many issues are resolved in newer SDK versions.
