## Why Adapty UA?

Measuring user acquisition performance is challenging. Data is often scattered across platforms, attribution becomes difficult due to privacy changes, and building custom solutions takes significant time.

Adapty UA provides built-in attribution and unified analytics in a single marketing dashboard. All your acquisition metrics—from ad spend to installs to subscription revenue—are automatically consolidated and updated in real-time. No more reconciling data across spreadsheets or switching between multiple tools. You can focus on growing your app instead of managing data systems.

## How it works

Adapty User Acquisition attributes app installs and subscription revenue to ad campaigns by combining data from ad platforms, tracking links, and your app.

At a high level:
- Ad platforms provide campaign structure and ad spend
- Tracking links generated in Adapty UA carry campaign context from the web to the app install
- The Adapty SDK sends install and revenue events from your app

The attribution flow works as follows:

1. **A tracking link is generated in Adapty UA and added to an ad campaign.** The link contains campaign parameters such as the platform, campaign, ad set, and creative. 

2. **A user clicks the ad and installs the app from the app store.** The user is redirected via the tracking link and installs the app from the App Store or Google Play.

3. **The app sends an install event to Adapty.** On first launch, the Adapty SDK sends an install event. Adapty extracts the campaign parameters associated with this install.

4. **The install is attributed to a campaign.** Using the campaign parameters from the tracking link, Adapty associates the install with the campaign that generated it.

5. **Ad spend and revenue are connected.** Adapty pulls ad spend data from supported ad platforms (currently – Meta Ads and TikTok for Business) and links subscription and purchase events to the attributed installs.

As a result, Adapty provides campaign-level metrics such as installs, revenue, LTV, and ROAS in a unified analytics dashboard. You can analyze cohorts, track performance over time, and make data-driven optimization decisions—all without manually reconciling data from different sources.

Tracking links can also include custom parameters, allowing your app to handle [deferred deep links](ua-deferred-data.md) and react to campaign data when processing the install event.
