Once your Adapty integration is tested and working, you're ready to upload your build to App Store Connect and submit your app for Apple review.

:::tip
Before you submit, make sure you've completed the [Release checklist](release-checklist) to verify your Adapty integration, purchase flows, and store review requirements.

## Upload your build to App Store Connect

### Step 1. Archive your app in Xcode and upload it to App Store Connect

1. In Xcode, set the build destination to **Any iOS Device (arm64)**.

<Zoom>
    <img src="/assets/shared/img/build-target.webp"
         style={{
             border: '1px solid #727272',
             width: '700px',
             display: 'block',
             margin: '0 auto'
         }}
    />
</Zoom>

2. Select **Product** > **Archive** from the top menu bar.

<Zoom>
    <img src="/assets/shared/img/xcode-archive.webp"
         style={{
             border: '1px solid #727272',
             width: '500px',
             display: 'block',
             margin: '0 auto'
         }}
    />
</Zoom>

3. Wait for the archiving process to complete. The **Organizer** window opens automatically. Select your archive and click **Distribute App**.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/distribute-app.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272',
    width: '700px',
    display: 'block',
    margin: '0 auto'
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

4. Choose **App Store Connect** as the distribution method. Follow the prompts to complete the upload.

:::note
The upload may fail if required assets are missing, such as an app icon or launch screen. Check the Xcode error log for details.

<Zoom>
    <img src="/assets/shared/img/distribution-method.webp"
         style={{
             border: '1px solid #727272',
             width: '700px',
             display: 'block',
             margin: '0 auto'
         }}
    />
</Zoom>

### Step 2. Check the build in App Store Connect

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) and open your app.
2. Scroll to the **Build** section. Ensure that the build you just uploaded appears there.

:::note
It may take a few minutes for the build to appear in App Store Connect after uploading.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/app-store-build.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272',
    width: '700px',
    display: 'block',
    margin: '0 auto'
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

## Submit your app and products for review

After the build appears in the **Build** section, attach your in-app subscriptions and submit the app for Apple review.

### Step 1. Attach products to the submission

Each subscription must have the **Ready to Submit** status in App Store Connect before you can attach it. If a subscription is still in draft or missing metadata, it won't appear in the list.

1. On the same page, scroll to the **In-App Purchases and Subscriptions** section.
2. Click **Select in-app purchases or subscriptions**.

<Zoom>
    <img src="/assets/shared/img/app-store-select-products.webp"
         style={{
             border: '1px solid #727272',
             width: '700px',
             display: 'block',
             margin: '0 auto'
         }}
    />
</Zoom>

3. Select all products you want to include in this submission and click **Done**.

### Step 2. Submit for review

1. Complete all required fields on the page (description, screenshots, keywords, etc.).
2. In the **App Store Version Release** section, select whether you want to release your app automatically, manually, or on schedule after it is approved.
3. Click **Add for Review**, then click **Submit to App Review**.

Apple reviews apps within 1–2 days, though review times may vary.

## Verify your app in production

After Apple approves your app:

1. Make a real purchase (or wait for your first user to purchase).
2. Open the [**Event Feed**](https://app.adapty.io/event-feed) in the Adapty Dashboard and confirm that production transaction events appear.
3. Check that subscription events (renewals, cancellations) flow correctly — these depend on [App Store server notifications](enable-app-store-server-notifications) being configured.

If production events don't appear, verify your [App Store connection configuration](app-store-connection-configuration).

## Next steps

Your app is live. Start growing your subscription revenue:

- **[A/B testing](ab-tests)**: Experiment with different paywalls to find what converts best.
- **[Analytics](charts)**: Track subscription metrics like MRR, churn, and conversion.
- **Integrations**: Send subscription events to [analytics](analytics-integration) and [attribution](attribution-integration) platforms.
