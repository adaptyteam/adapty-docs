Adapty uses the [Google Play Developer API](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher) to validate purchases and sync subscription data. The default quota for this API is 3,000 queries per minute. If your app exceeds this limit, Google sends you an email notification. This commonly happens during [historical data imports](importing-historical-data-to-adapty) or in apps with a large number of active subscribers.

To avoid disruptions, request a quota increase from Google before running a large import or if you received a quota-exceeded notification.

## Before you start

Enable [Real-time Developer Notifications (RTDN)](enable-real-time-developer-notifications-rtdn) if you haven't already. RTDN delivers subscription updates via push notifications instead of polling, which reduces API consumption. Google may reject quota increase requests if RTDN is not enabled.

## Gather required information

Before opening the request form, collect the following values:

- **Developer Account ID**: To find it, in the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/), go to **Settings > Developer account > Account details**. The ID is listed at the top of the page.
- **App package name**: Your Android app's package name (for example, `com.example.app`). Find it in the Google Play Console on your app's **Dashboard** page.
- **Google Cloud project number**: To find it, in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), select your project. The project number is on the **Dashboard** page.

## Request the quota increase

1. Open the [Google Play Developer API quota increase request form](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/apiqr).
2. Enter your Developer Account ID, app package name, and Google Cloud project number.
3. Select the API and quota bucket that needs an increase. If you received an email from Google about exceeding quota, it specifies which bucket.
4. In the justification field, explain that you use a third-party subscription management service that requires API access to validate purchases and sync subscription data.
5. For the requested quota, enter the amount you need. If you are not sure how much to request, check your current usage in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) under **IAM & Admin > Quotas** (filter for "Google Play Android Developer API"), then send your usage data and the number of historical entries you plan to import to [support@adapty.io](mailto:support@adapty.io) so we can help you determine the right amount.
6. Submit the form.

Google typically processes quota increase requests within a few business days.
