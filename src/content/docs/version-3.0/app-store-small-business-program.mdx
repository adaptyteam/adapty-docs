Organizations that receive up to US$1 million in yearly App Store proceeds are eligible to participate in Apple's [Small Business program](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/). If you enroll, the standard 30% store commission rate is lowered to **15%**, or even **10%** for [EEA transactions with an alternative payment provider](https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/).

:::note
Apple's alternative payment policies are subject to ongoing litigation, and vary from country to country.
:::

This discount is **not automatic** — you must apply to take part in the program. If you are approved, you must [change your Adapty settings](#configure-adapty) to account for the reduced commission.

This article describes the eligibility requirements, the enrollment process, and the [settings you need to change](#configure-adapty) in Adapty.

## Eligibility requirements

Apple determines SBP eligibility based on your **yearly proceeds** — the previous calendar year's sales **after** store commission and taxes.

To be eligible, the yearly proceeds of your organization and its <InlineTooltip tooltip="Associated Developer Accounts">Accounts where you or your organization hold majority ownership (>50%) or have decision-making authority.</InlineTooltip> must total US$1 million or less.

Newly created organizations are automatically eligible to apply for the program.

## Apply for the program

#### Before you apply

Make sure that you:

- Are the Account Holder in the Apple Developer Program
- Have accepted the latest Paid Applications contract in App Store Connect
- Can list all your Associated Developer Accounts

#### Enrollment

1. Go to the [App Store Small Business Program enrollment page](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/).
2. Click **Enroll** and sign in with your Apple Developer account.
3. Review the pre-filled information (name, email, Team ID) and submit.

#### Review

The review process can take over a month. If you qualify, you'll receive an approval email from Apple.

After you're approved, there's a waiting period. The reduced commission takes effect on the 15th day of Apple's [next fiscal period](https://adapty.io/apple-fiscal-calendar/). It does not apply to earlier transactions.

While you wait for the changes, configure Adapty.

## Configure Adapty

Apple doesn't automatically share your Small Business Program status with Adapty. To ensure correct revenue calculation and event handling, specify this status on a per-app basis.

:::warning
Configure your SBP status in Adapty **as soon as you receive approval**.

If you do it *after* Apple reduces your commission rate, Adapty will not repeat webhook calls and integration events for your past transactions.
:::

Open [**App Settings** → **General**](https://app.adapty.io/account), and find the **Small Business Program** section. Click **Add period**.

In the **Period** field, select a date range that matches your program membership start and end dates. You can modify the end date if you [lose eligibility](#losing-eligibility).

To add more membership periods, click **Add period** again.

The membership status only applies **to the date range you specify**. If your organization remains eligible, its membership carries over to the next calendar year. However, Apple does not notify Adapty of this extension. Add a **new period** if you remain in the program beyond the original time span.

To verify your configuration, open the [Revenue chart](revenue) and select **Proceeds after store commission**. Confirm that the displayed proceeds reflect the reduced commission rate.

## Losing eligibility

When your total proceeds for the current calendar year surpass US$1 million, you lose program membership, and Apple begins to apply the standard 30% sales commission.

:::important
If your business leaves the Small Business Program, **immediately change the exit date** in your settings. Otherwise, Adapty will continue to calculate commission at the reduced rate.
:::

You can re-qualify for the program **the year after** your yearly proceeds fall back below US$1 million. Read the [official program terms](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/) for more details.
