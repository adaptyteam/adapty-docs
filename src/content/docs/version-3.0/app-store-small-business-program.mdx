If your organization receives up to US$1 million in yearly App Store proceeds, it is eligible to participate in the [App Store Small Business program](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/). 

The App Store commission for the program's participants is **15% instead of 30%**. In some cases, it is even lower: Apple **only deducts 10%** from [EU transactions with third-party payment providers](https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/).

:::note
Apple's treatment of third-party payment providers is subject to ongoing court cases, and varies from country to country. Double-check your commission estimate with current Apple policies.
:::

However, this discount is **not automatic** — you have to manually enroll into the program. If you are approved, you must [change your Adapty settings](#configure-adapty) to account for the reduced commission.

This article describes the eligibility requirements, the enrollment process, and the settings you need to change in Adapty.

## Eligibility requirements

Apple determines SBP eligibility based on your **yearly proceeds** — the previous calendar year's sales **after** store commission and taxes.

To be eligible, the yearly proceeds of your organization and its <InlineTooltip tooltip="Associated Developer Accounts">Accounts where you or your organization hold majority ownership (>50%) or have decision-making authority.</InlineTooltip> must total US$1 million or less.

Newly created organizations are automatically eligible to apply for the program.

## Apply for the program

#### Before you apply

Make sure that you:

- Are the Account Holder in the Apple Developer Program
- Have accepted the latest Paid Applications contract in App Store Connect
- Can list all your Associated Developer Accounts

#### Enrollment

1. Go to the [App Store Small Business Program enrollment page](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/).
2. Click **Enroll** and sign in with your Apple Developer account.
3. Review the pre-filled information (name, email, Team ID) and submit.

#### Review

The review process can take over a month. If you qualify, you'll receive an approval email from Apple.

After you're approved, there's a waiting period. The reduced commission takes effect on the 15th day of the next fiscal month, and does not apply to earlier transactions.

While you wait for the commission to take effect, configure Adapty:

## Configure Adapty

Apple doesn't automatically share your Small Business Program status with Adapty. To ensure correct revenue calculation and event handling, you need to specify this status on a per-app basis.

Open [**App Settings** → **General**](https://app.adapty.io/account), and find the **Small Business Program** section. Click **Add period**.

In the **Period** field, select the date range that matches your program membership start and end dates. You can modify the end date if you [lose eligibility](#losing-eligibility).

To add more membership periods, click **Add period** again.

:::warning
If you set a start date in the past, Adapty will not resend webhooks or integration events that were already processed. Set your start date as early as possible to keep integration data accurate.
:::

The membership status applies only to the date range you specify. Add a new period if you remain in the program beyond that time span.

To verify your configuration, open the [Revenue chart](revenue) and switch to **Proceeds after store commission**. Confirm that the displayed proceeds reflect the 15% commission rate.

## Losing eligibility

When your total proceeds for the current calendar year surpass USD$1 million, you lose program membership, and Apple begins to apply the standard 30% sales commission.

:::important
If your business leaves the Small Business Program, enter the exit date in Adapty as soon as possible. Without an exit date, Adapty continues to calculate commission at the reduced 15% rate, which overstates your proceeds.
:::

You can re-qualify for the program **the year after** your yearly proceeds fall back below USD$1 million. Read the [official program terms](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/) for more details.
