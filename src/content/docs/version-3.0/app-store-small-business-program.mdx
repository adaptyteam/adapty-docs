Organizations that receive up to 1 million USD in yearly App Store proceeds are eligible to participate in Apple's [Small Business program](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/). If you enroll, the standard 30% store commission rate is lowered to **15%**.

Program members must **change their Adapty settings** to ensure correct revenue calculations and integration event handling. 

This article describes:
* [How to set up Adapty](#configure-adapty) if your app is enrolled in the Small Business Program
* [How to enroll in the program](#apply-for-the-program) if you want to reduce your store commission

## Configure Adapty

Adapty can apply the reduced commission rate to your [analytics](analytics) and [integration events](analytics-integration). To enable this, specify your Small Business Program status on a per-app basis.

:::warning
To ensure a seamless transition, configure your SBP status in Adapty **as soon as you receive approval**.

If you retroactively reduce the commission rate, Adapty will change the analytics data, but won't repeat past transactions' webhooks and integration events.
:::

1. Open [**App Settings** → **General**](https://app.adapty.io/account)
2. Find the **Small Business Program** section. 
3. Click **Add period**.
4. Select the membership start date.
5. Select an end date, or enable the **At the current moment** checkmark to indefinitely extend this status. If you [lose eligibility](#losing-eligibility) in the future, you can modify the end date.
6. Click **Apply**.

If your organization remains eligible for the program, its membership carries over to the next calendar year. But the membership status only applies **to the date range you specify**.

* Click **Add period** to add a new membership period.
* To extend this status indefinitely, enable the **At the current moment** checkmark.

To verify your configuration, open the [Revenue chart](revenue) and select **Proceeds after store commission**. Confirm that the displayed proceeds reflect the reduced commission rate.

## Apply for the program

### Eligibility requirements
Apple determines SBP eligibility based on your **yearly proceeds** — the previous calendar year's sales **after** store commission and taxes.

To be eligible, the yearly proceeds of your organization and its <InlineTooltip tooltip="Associated Developer Accounts">Accounts where you or your organization hold majority ownership (>50%) or have decision-making authority.</InlineTooltip> must total 1 million USD or less.

Newly created organizations are automatically eligible to apply for the program.

### Before you apply

Make sure that you:

- Are the Account Holder in the Apple Developer Program
- Have accepted the latest Paid Applications contract in App Store Connect
- Can list all your Associated Developer Accounts

### Enrollment

1. Go to the [App Store Small Business Program enrollment page](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/).
2. Click **Enroll** and sign in with your Apple Developer account.
3. Review the pre-filled information (name, email, Team ID) and submit.

### Review

The review process can take over a month. If you qualify, you'll receive an approval email from Apple.

After you're approved, there's a waiting period. The reduced commission takes effect on the 15th day of Apple's [next fiscal period](https://adapty.io/apple-fiscal-calendar/). It does not apply to earlier transactions.

### Losing eligibility

When your total proceeds for the current calendar year surpass 1 million USD, you lose program membership, and Apple begins to apply the standard 30% sales commission.

:::important
If your business leaves the Small Business Program, **immediately change the exit date** in your settings. Otherwise, Adapty will continue to calculate commission at the reduced rate.
:::

You can re-qualify for the program **the year after** your yearly proceeds fall back below 1 million USD. Read the [official program terms](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/) for more details.
