Adapty React Native SDK 3.14.0 is a major release that introduces improvements that require migration steps on your end:

- The `registerEventHandlers` method has been replaced with the `setEventHandlers` method.
- In `AdaptyOnboardingView`, event handlers are now passed as individual props instead of an `eventHandlers` object
- A new, simplified import style has been introduced for UI components
- The `logShowOnboarding` method has been deleted
- The minimum React Native version has been updated to 0.73.0
- The default iOS presentation style for paywalls and onboardings has changed from page sheet to full screen

## Replace `registerEventHandlers` with `setEventHandlers`

The `registerEventHandlers` method used for working with Adapty Paywall and Onboarding Builder has been replaced with the `setEventHandlers` method.
If you use the Adapty Paywall Builder and/or Adapty Onboarding Builder, find `registerEventHandlers` in your app code and replace it with `setEventHandlers`.

The change has been introduced to make the method behavior clearer: Handlers now work one-at-a-time because each returns `true`/`false`, and having multiple handlers for a single event made the resulting behavior unclear.

Note that when using React components like `AdaptyOnboardingView` or `AdaptyPaywallView`, you don't need to return `true`/`false` from event handlers since you control the component's visibility through your own state management. Return values are only needed for modal screen presentation where the SDK manages the view lifecycle.

:::important
Calling `setEventHandlers` multiple times will override the handlers you provide, replacing both default and previously set handlers for those specific events.
:::

```diff showLineNumbers 
- const unsubscribe = view.registerEventHandlers({
-    // your event handlers
- })

 const unsubscribe = view.setEventHandlers({
    // your event handlers
 })
``` 

## Update import paths for UI components

Adapty SDK 3.14.0 introduces a simplified import style for UI components. Instead of importing from `react-native-adapty/dist/ui`, you can now import directly from `react-native-adapty`.

The new import style is more consistent with standard React Native practices and makes the import statements cleaner. If you are using UI components like `AdaptyPaywallView` or `AdaptyOnboardingView`, update your imports as shown below:

```diff showLineNumbers
- import { AdaptyPaywallView } from 'react-native-adapty/dist/ui';
+ import { AdaptyPaywallView } from 'react-native-adapty';

- import { AdaptyOnboardingView } from 'react-native-adapty/dist/ui';
+ import { AdaptyOnboardingView } from 'react-native-adapty';

- import { createPaywallView } from 'react-native-adapty/dist/ui';
+ import { createPaywallView } from 'react-native-adapty';

- import { createOnboardingView } from 'react-native-adapty/dist/ui';
+ import { createOnboardingView } from 'react-native-adapty';
```

:::note
For backward compatibility, the old import style (`react-native-adapty/dist/ui`) is still supported. However, we recommend using the new import style for consistency and clarity.

## Update onboarding event handlers in the React component

Event handlers for onboardings have been moved outside the `eventHandlers` object in `AdaptyOnboardingView`. If you are displaying onboardings using `AdaptyOnboardingView`, update the event handling structure.

:::important
Note the way we recommend implementing event handlers. To avoid recreating objects on each render, use `useCallback` for functions that handle events.
:::

```diff showLineNumbers
 import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
- import { AdaptyOnboardingView } from 'react-native-adapty/dist/ui';
+ import { AdaptyOnboardingView } from 'react-native-adapty';
+ import type { OnboardingEventHandlers } from 'react-native-adapty';
+
+ function MyOnboarding({ onboarding }) {
+   const onAnalytics = useCallback<OnboardingEventHandlers['onAnalytics']>((event, meta) => {}, []);
+   const onClose = useCallback<OnboardingEventHandlers['onClose']>((actionId, meta) => {}, []);
+   const onCustom = useCallback<OnboardingEventHandlers['onCustom']>((actionId, meta) => {}, []);
+   const onPaywall = useCallback<OnboardingEventHandlers['onPaywall']>((actionId, meta) => {}, []);
+   const onStateUpdated = useCallback<OnboardingEventHandlers['onStateUpdated']>((action, meta) => {}, []);
+   const onFinishedLoading = useCallback<OnboardingEventHandlers['onFinishedLoading']>((meta) => {}, []);
+   const onError = useCallback<OnboardingEventHandlers['onError']>((error) => {}, []);
+
   return (
     <AdaptyOnboardingView
       onboarding={onboarding}
       style={styles.container}
-       eventHandlers={{
-         onAnalytics(event, meta) { /* ... */ },
-         onClose(actionId, meta) { /* ... */ },
-         onCustom(actionId, meta) { /* ... */ },
-         onPaywall(actionId, meta) { /* ... */ },
-         onStateUpdated(action, meta) { /* ... */ },
-         onFinishedLoading(meta) { /* ... */ },
-         onError(error) { /* ... */ },
-       }}
+       onAnalytics={onAnalytics}
+       onClose={onClose}
+       onCustom={onCustom}
+       onPaywall={onPaywall}
+       onStateUpdated={onStateUpdated}
+       onFinishedLoading={onFinishedLoading}
+       onError={onError}
     />
   );
+ }
```

:::note
For backward compatibility, the `eventHandlers` prop is still supported but is deprecated. We recommend migrating to individual event handler props as shown above.
:::

## Delete `logShowOnboarding`

In Adapty SDK 3.14.0, we have deleted the `logShowOnboarding` method from the SDK.
If you have been using this method, it won't be available when you upgrade the SDK to version 3.14 or later.

Instead, you can [create onboardings in the Adapty no-code onboarding builder](onboardings.md). Analytics for these onboardings are tracked automatically, and you have a lot of customization options.

## Update React Native

Starting from Adapty SDK 3.14.0, the minimum supported version of React Native is 0.73.0. If you are using an earlier version, update React Native to version 0.73.0 or later, so your experience with the Adapty SDK is consistent and reliable.

## Update iOS presentation style for modal paywalls and onboardings

In Adapty SDK 3.14.0, the default iOS presentation style for paywalls and onboardings displayed using the `view.present()` method has changed from page sheet to full screen.

If you want to keep the previous page sheet presentation style, pass the `iosPresentationStyle` parameter to the `present()` method:

```typescript showLineNumbers title="React Native (TSX)"
try {
  await view.present({ iosPresentationStyle: 'page_sheet' });
} catch (error) {
  // handle the error
}
```
