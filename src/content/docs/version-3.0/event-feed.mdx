Event feed allows you to visually track [Events](events) generated by Adapty and check the status of their export to 3rd-party integrations, including the webhook. 

:::warning

Keep in mind that transactions created using the [server-side API (version 1)](server-side-api-specs-legacy#requests) do not appear in the **Event Feed**. To ensure they are included, use the [server-side API (version 2)](api-adapty/operations/setTransaction) instead.

    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}

:::note
AppsFlyer, Facebook Ads, and Branch sending status could be inaccurate because they do not always return errors when they occur.
