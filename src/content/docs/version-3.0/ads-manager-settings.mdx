## Campaign groups

On the **Campaign groups** tab, you can see all Apple Ads accounts connected to Apple Ads Manager and add new ones. If you connect several Apple Ads accounts, all their analytics will be aggregated in a single Apple Ads Manager dashboard.

To add a new Apple Ads account, click **Connect Apple Ads account** and follow the [guide](adapty-ads-manager-get-started.md).

## Manage subscription

On the **Manage subscription** tab, you can see your current subscription plan and update your payment method.

## User settings

On the **User settings** tab, you can turn on the **Hide Paused by Default** switch. When enabled, paused campaigns, ad groups, and keywords will be hidden to help you focus on active performance data.

Avoid enabling this option if you frequently experiment with launching and pausing different campaigns, ad groups, and keywords, since you may want to access paused items at any time.
