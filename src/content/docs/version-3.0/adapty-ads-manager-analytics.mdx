## Metrics

The columns available for display are grouped into several main categories:
- **General**: Meta properties of ads and campaigns.
- **Performance**: Information about the way users respond to your ads.
- **Insights** (for keywords and search terms only): Impression share and search popularity. 
- **Advanced downloads**: New downloads and redownloads, including Total, View-Through, and Tap-Through values.
- **Conversions**: Revenue-related metrics linked to ads and campaigns.
- **Cohort**: Time-based analytics of user groups.

## Customize which metrics to show

On each tab, you can customize which columns to display and in which order. You can also save views to get back to them quickly anytime.

To customize the columns displayed and their order, click **Columns > Edit columns** on the top right. Then, select columns in the list and arrange them by dragging and dropping. Click **Save** to apply the changes.
