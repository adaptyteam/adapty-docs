Adapty is an in-app purchase platform for mobile apps. It handles subscriptions, one-time purchases, and consumables — from purchase processing and receipt validation to analytics, A/B testing, and integrations.

Here is how Adapty works for different scenarios.

## I'm launching a new app with in-app purchases

Whether you're going to sell subscriptions, one-time purchases, or consumables, Adapty covers the full stack:

- **SDKs for 7 platforms**: iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Kotlin Multiplatform, and Capacitor.
- **Purchase handling**: Subscriptions with renewals and retry logic, one-time purchases, consumables, and receipt validation — all managed for you.
- **No-code paywall builder**: Design and ship paywalls without writing UI code.
- **Analytics from day one**: Track revenue, trials, conversions, and more as soon as your first users arrive.

Ready to get started? Follow the [Quickstart guide](quickstart).

## I want A/B tests, analytics, and integrations

Adapty helps you optimize what's already working:

- **A/B testing**: Test different prices, paywall designs, trial lengths, and promotional offers to find what converts best. Use [Growth Autopilot](autopilot) to get a data-driven test plan based on competitor and market analysis.
- **Analytics charts**: Track MRR, LTV, churn, retention, and dozens of other metrics.
- **Audience segmentation**: Target specific user groups with tailored paywalls and offers.
- **Remote paywall configuration**: Iterate on your paywalls without releasing a new app version.
- **Third-party integrations**: Send purchase events to Amplitude, AppsFlyer, Adjust, Mixpanel, and other tools your team already uses.

## I want to implement in-app purchases with an LLM

Adapty's docs are optimized for use with AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, and others. Every page is available as plain Markdown, and we provide step-by-step LLM-assisted implementation guides for each platform:

- **Copy-paste-ready guides**: Send the guide to your LLM and let it walk you through each implementation stage.
- **Markdown access**: Add `.md` to any doc URL or click **Copy for LLM** to get a clean text version.
- **Context7 MCP support**: Connect Adapty docs directly to your LLM-powered IDE.

## I want to run and optimize Apple Ads campaigns

If you're running Apple Search Ads, Adapty's Apple Ads Manager connects your campaign performance directly with revenue metrics — no MMP required:

- **Real-time performance data**: Track campaigns, ad groups, and keywords.
- **End-to-end revenue tracking**: Follow the chain from search to install to trial to subscription to LTV.
- **AI predictions and recommendations**: Forecast returns and get scaling suggestions.
- **Rule-based automations**: Keep your CPA and ROAS targets stable.

## I want to track where my users come from

Adapty User Acquisition is a built-in attribution solution that connects ad spend with app installs and subscription revenue:

- **Unified marketing dashboard**: See ROAS, installs, and revenue across all your channels in one place.
- **Built-in attribution**: Connect ad campaigns with installs and revenue without relying on external MMPs.
- **Tracking links**: Generate links in Adapty and add them to your campaigns for accurate attribution.

- **Cohort analysis**: Analyze acquisition performance and user behavior over time.

## I want to iterate fast without app releases

Once Adapty is integrated, most of the day-to-day work happens in the dashboard — no new app versions required:

- **No-code paywall builder**: Design and update paywalls in a visual editor, publish changes instantly.
- **A/B testing from the dashboard**: Launch experiments, adjust pricing, and swap offers without touching code.
- **Dashboard analytics**: Monitor revenue, churn, trials, and conversions in real time.
- **Slack and email reports**: Get automated updates on the metrics that matter to your team.

## I sell on the web and need a mobile app

If your users already pay through a website, and you're adding a mobile app, Adapty syncs purchases across platforms:

- **Stripe and Paddle integration**: Sync web purchases into Adapty automatically.
- **Web-to-mobile sync**: Users who paid on the web get access in your app, and vice versa.
- **Unified cross-platform analytics**: See web and mobile revenue in one dashboard.

Set up [Stripe integration](stripe), [Paddle integration](paddle), or learn how to [sync web and mobile subscribers](sync-subscribers-from-web).

## I'm migrating from another tool

Adapty makes it easy to migrate from other subscription platforms:

- **Migration guides**: Step-by-step instructions for moving from other subscription platforms.
- **Observer Mode**: Keep your existing billing code and adopt Adapty incrementally with [Observer mode](observer-vs-full-mode) — start with analytics and A/B tests, then expand when ready.
- **Historical data import**: Bring your existing transaction history into Adapty so your analytics stay complete.
