You can set up any image or video on a paywall, but sometimes you might want to display a custom image or video that’s personalized for the user — for example, a video with their chosen avatar. That’s where custom media comes in.

Custom media is an image or video that your app calls by ID from your code. It replaces a standard media file you’ve added to the paywall in the Paywall Builder.

:::info
To use this feature, update the Adapty SDK to version 3.7.0 or later.

## Where can I use custom media?

Anywhere you’d normally use a regular image or video:

- As a hero image
- As a hero video
- As a regular icon
- In a card background
- In a carousel background

## How to use custom media?
To set up custom media:

1. Select the **Use custom media ID** checkbox under the upload area.

2. Enter the media ID. For hero images and hero videos, IDs are predefined.

3. Upload a fallback image or video in the file upload section.

4. For more information, see <InlineTooltip tooltip="the guides on how to fetch Paywall Builder paywalls in your app">[iOS](get-pb-paywalls.md), [Android](android-get-pb-paywalls.md), [React Native](react-native-get-pb-paywalls.md), [Flutter](flutter-get-pb-paywalls.md), and [Unity](unity-get-pb-paywalls.md)</InlineTooltip> and call the media by its ID in your code.

If the Adapty SDK version is below 3.7.0, or if the custom media ID isn't defined in your code, the fallback image or video will be displayed instead.
