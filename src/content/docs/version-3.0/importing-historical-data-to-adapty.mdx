After installing the Adapty SDK and releasing your app, you can access your users and subscribers in the [Profiles](profiles-crm) section. But what if you have legacy infrastructure and need to migrate to Adapty, or simply want to see your existing data in Adapty?

:::note
Data import is not mandatory

Adapty will automatically grant access levels to historical users and restore their purchase events once they open the app with the Adapty SDK integrated. For this use case, importing historical data is not necessary. However, importing data ensures precise analytics if you have a significant number of historical transactions, although it is generally not required for migration.
:::

To import data to Adapty:

1. Export your transactions to a CSV file (separate files should be provided for iOS, Android, and Stripe). Please refer to the [Import file format section](importing-historical-data-to-adapty#import-file-format) below for detailed requirements.
2. If any file exceeds 1 GB, prepare a data sample with approximately 100 lines.
3. Upload all the files to Google Drive (you can compress them, but keep them separate).
4. For iOS transactions, ensure the **In-app purchase API** section in the [**App settings**](https://app.adapty.io/settings/ios-sdk)is filled out with the **Issuer ID**, **Key ID**, and the **Private key** (.P8 file) even if you use the StoreKit 1. See the [Provide Issuer ID and Key ID](app-store-connection-configuration#step-2-provide-issuer-id-and-key-id) and [Upload In-App Purchase Key file](app-store-connection-configuration#step-3-upload-in-app-purchase-key-file) sections for detailed instructions.
5. Share the links with our team via  [email](mailto:support@adapty.io) or through the online chat in the Adapty Dashboard.

Do not worry, importing historical data will not create duplicates, even if that data overlaps with existing entries in Adapty.

## Known limitations for Android

1. Only active subscriptions will be restored; expired transactions will not be.
2. Only the latest renewals in a subscription will be restored; the entire chain of purchases will not be.
3. If the product price has changed since the purchase, the current price will be used, which may result in incorrect pricing.

:::note
If you have a large volume of Android transactions, you may need to [request a Google Play Developer API quota increase](google-play-quota-increase) before starting the import to avoid exceeding the default API limit.

## Import file format

Please prepare your data in a file or files that meet the following rules:

- [ ] The file format is .CSV.
- [ ] Separate files for Android, iOS, and Stripe imports.
- [ ] Every import file contains all [required columns](importing-historical-data-to-adapty#required-fields).
- [ ] The columns in the import file(s) have headers.
- [ ] The column headers are exactly as in the **Column name** column in the table below. Please check for typos.
- [ ] Columns that are not required can be absent from the file. Don't add empty columns for data you don't have.
- [ ] Import files should not have extra columns not mentioned in the table. If present, please delete them.
- [ ] Values are separated by commas.
- [ ] Values are not enclosed in quotes.
- [ ] If there are several **apple_original_transaction_id**'s for one user, add all of them as separate lines for each **apple_original_transaction_id**. Otherwise, we may not be able to restore consumable purchases. 

Please use the following files as samples for [iOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adaptyteam/adapty-docs/refs/heads/main/Downloads/adapty_import_ios_sample.csv) and [Android](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adaptyteam/adapty-docs/refs/heads/main/Downloads/adapty_import_android_sample.csv).
