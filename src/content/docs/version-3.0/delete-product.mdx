You can only delete products that are not used in paywalls.

To delete the product:

1. Go to **[Products](https://app.adapty.io/products)** from the Adapty main menu.
2. Click the **3-dot** button next to the product and select **Delete**.

<Zoom>

  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

2. Enter the product name you're about to delete.
