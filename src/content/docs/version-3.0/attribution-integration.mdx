Adapty can exchange information with third-party services to attribute subscription events to specific marketing campaigns. This exchange allows you to:

* Discover which marketing strategies yield the most revenue
* Filter Adapty [subscription charts](analytics-charts) by attribution
* Use the capabilities of a third-party service to analyze Adapty subscription data

You can set it up in one of two ways:

* [Integrated attribution](#integrated-attribution) requires minimum setup, and allows Adapty to exchange data with 9 popular platforms.
* [Manual attribution](#manual-attribution) requires you to fetch attribution data from third-party service APIs yourself before you can send it to Adapty.

:::tip
Enable [User Acquisition Analytics](user-acquisition) for a complete overview of your application's economy.

Adapty UA is an easy-to-configure web dashboard that consolidates data from different sources to detect efficient user acquisition strategies.

:::warning
Keep your data clean: avoid event duplication and attribution conflicts. Follow the advice in the **[Prevent data issues](#prevent-data-issues)** section to ensure that a new data source doesn't pollute your analytics.

## Integrated attribution

Adapty offers out-of-the-box attribution integration with 9 popular services. These platforms can automatically receive [subscription data](events) from Adapty, process each purchase, and respond with an appropriate attribution.

Each platform has a different workflow, but the steps are similarly simple:

1. **Set up automatic data sharing.** Authorize Adapty to communicate with your platform of choice.
2. **Integrate the Aadpty SDK.** Some platforms require extra code to set attribution data.
3. **Disable other event sharing services and attribution sources** to avoid [event duplication](#avoid-event-duplication) and [data conflicts](#select-a-single-attribution-source).

Read the platform-specific guide for a detailed integration overview:

- [Adjust](adjust)
- [Airbridge](airbridge)
- [Apple Search Ads](apple-search-ads)
- [AppsFlyer](appsflyer)
- [Asapty](asapty)
- [Branch](branch)
- [Facebook Ads](facebook-ads)
- [Singular](singular)
- [Tenjin](tenjin)

:::note
If you want Adapty to expand the list, [contact support](mailto:support@adapty.io) and express your interest in a particular service.

## Manual attribution

If Adapty doesn't offer [integrated attribution](#integrated-attribution) with your service of choice, you need to write your own code to exchange data with the attribution source.

1. **Retrieve data from the attribution service**. Use the service's API to request attribution data .
2. **Create a dictionary with the attribution data you received.**

    The dictionary may contain the following keys:

    - `status` (`organic`, `non-organic`, or `unknown`)
    - `channel`
    - `campaign`
    - `ad_group`
    - `ad_set`
    - `creative`

    :::important
    * All the keys are optional.
    * Adapty ignores the keys not on the list.
    * The value of each key may be up to 50 characters long.
    :::

    **Example**:

    ```swift showLineNumbers title="Swift"
    let attribution = [
        "status": "non_organic",
        "channel": "Google Ads",
        "campaign": "Christmas Sale",
        "ad_group": "ad group 1",
        "ad_set": "ad set 1",
        "creative": "creative id 1"
    ]
    ```

3. **Set the attribution data**:

    Pass the attribution dictionary to the `updateAttribution` method. Once you set the attribution value, you cannot override it:

    ```swift showLineNumbers title="Swift"
    Adapty.updateAttribution(attribution, source: "custom") { error in
        if error == nil {
            // successful attribution update
        }
    }
    ```

    **Parameters:**

    - `attribution` (required): dictionary with attribution data.
    - `source` (required): attribution source. Set to `.custom` if your attribution provider does not support [integrated attribution](#integrated-attribution).

4. **Disable other event sharing services and attribution sources** to avoid [event duplication](#avoid-event-duplication) and [data conflicts](#select-a-single-attribution-source).

## Prevent data issues

### Select a single attribution source

Do not enable attribution integration with multiple platforms at once. Adapty can only accept one attribution source at a time, and once it saves the attribution value, it cannot override it.

If you enable multiple attribution sources, Adapty will select the source with the most data — not necessarily the best data.

For example, non-organic [Apple Search Ads attribution](apple-search-ads) will always take priority on iOS. To turn Apple Search Ads attribution off, open the [**App Settings** -> **Apple Search Ads** tab](https://app.adapty.io/settings/apple-search-ads), and toggle the **Receive Apple Search Ads attribution** switch.

### Avoid event duplication

If you use Adapty to share real-time subscription data with your attribution services, **you need to disable** other services that serve the same purpose. If you connected your Facebook account to AppsFlyer, Adjust, or Branch, it will automatically forward your events to these services, unless you opt out.

Duplicate events can skew your analytics, and make it hard to interpret data. Once you configured Adapty event sharing, turn third-party event forwarding capabilities **off**.
