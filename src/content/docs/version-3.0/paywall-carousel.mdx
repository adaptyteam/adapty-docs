A carousel is a dynamic set of swipeable cards that can be moved left or right, creating a captivating visual experience. It's a fantastic tool to craft paywalls that not only draw attention but also engage users with interactive content.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/81eaa26-PB_carousel.gif"
  style={{
    border: 'none', /* border width and color */
    width: '200px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

:::warning

Carousels are only available in the [new Paywall Builder](adapty-paywall-builder), which works with iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs version 3.0 or higher, and Flutter and Unity SDKs version 3.3.0 or higher. The legacy Paywall Builder with Adapty SDK v2.x or earlier does not support paywall carousel functionality.

:::

Use the power of carousels to elevate your paywall's appeal:

1. **Add Cards**: Start by adding cards to your carousel, each one a canvas for your creative touch.
2. **Customize Cards**: Populate your cards with various elements—images, text, buttons, and more. The carousel's height setting ensures all cards are uniformly sized, delivering a sleek and consistent appearance.

Embrace the flexibility of carousels to showcase featured products, highlight exclusive offers, or narrate compelling stories. With this engaging element, your paywalls will not only stand out but also provide a seamless and immersive user experience.
