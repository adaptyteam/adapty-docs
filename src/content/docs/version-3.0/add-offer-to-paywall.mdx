Offers in the App Store and Google Play are special deals or discounts provided by these platforms for in-app purchases.

To make an offer visible and selectable within a [paywall](paywalls) for your app's users, follow these steps:

While [configuring the products on a paywall](create-paywall), choose an offer you [created earlier](create-offer) for this product from the **Offer** list. The list is available only for the products that have offers.

:::info

Paywalls created with the Adapty Paywall Builder will display only the first phase of a [multi-phase Google subscription offer](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/12154973). However, rest assured that when a user purchases the product, all offer phases will be applied as configured in Google Play.
