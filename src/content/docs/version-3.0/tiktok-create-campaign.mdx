In this step-by-step guide, you will learn how to create and set up ads for your app in TikTok for Business, so you can optimize them and track their performance easily.

## Step 1. Add business info

If you are just getting started with TikTok for Business, you need to add your business info first:

1. Go to [https://ads.tiktok.com](https://ads.tiktok.com) and click **Get started**.
2. Sign up using your email or your TikTok account.
3. Enter your business info and follow the prompts on the screen.

Once your business account is approved, you will be redirected to creating your first campaign.

## Step 2. Create a pixel

You will need a TikTok pixel to connect your campaign data to revenue and get better results:
1. Go to [**Events Manager**](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/events_manager/home). Click **Connect data source**.
   <ZoomImage id="tiktok-data-source.webp" />
2. Select **Web** as a data source type.
   <ZoomImage id="tiktok-data-source-type.webp" />
3. In the **Add your website** window, click **Skip**.
   <ZoomImage id="add-your-website.webp" />
4. Select **Manual setup** and click **Next**.
   <ZoomImage id="manual-setup-tiktok.webp" />
5. Select **TikTok pixel + Events API** and click **Next**.
   <ZoomImage id="pixel-setup-tiktok.webp" />
6. Give your pixel a name and click **Create**.
   <ZoomImage id="tiktok-pixel.webp" />
7. For [Adapty User Acquisition](adapty-user-acquisition.md), you won't need to complete the full installation of the pixel. So, you can just close the setup window, and your pixel will appear on the list.
8. To make this pixel available for use in campaigns, you need to send a test event to it from [Adapty User Acquisition](adapty-user-acquisition.md):
   1. [Create a new TikTok campaign](ua-tiktok.md).
   2. Expand a platform-specific section – e.g., iOS.
   3. Select a pixel from the dropdown.
   4. Click **Send test event**.
      <ZoomImage id="tiktok-test-event.webp" />
   5. In the dropdown, select an event you will be using for optimization in the ad.
   6. In TikTok for Business, open your pixel and switch to the **Test events** tab. Copy `test_event_code`.
      <ZoomImage id="test-event-code.webp" />
   7. Paste it to the **Test event code** field in Adapty and click **Send**.
      <ZoomImage id="adapty-test-event.webp" width="500px" />
9. The test event will appear in TikTok in several minutes. When you see it in your pixel details, you can proceed with the campaign setup in TikTok Ads Manager.

## Step 3. Select the campaign objective

:::important
This tutorial uses the Quick setup view in TikTok Ads Manager. A few recommended settings appear only in the Full view, which we point out in the relevant steps.
:::

Go to the [ad creation page](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/nb_creation/create/objectives) in the Ads Manager.

On the first screen, select the advertising objective and click **Continue**.

Select **Sales > Website conversion**.

<ZoomImage id="tiktok-objective.webp" />

## Step 4. Fill in the campaign info

Next, fill in the campaign info:

1. Name your campaign in the **Campaign name** field.
2. In the **Optimization goal** field, select **Conversion**. 
   <ZoomImage id="tiktok-campaign-info.webp" />
3. Select your active pixel from the dropdown and choose an **Optimization event**. Note that only active events are available for selection. If the event you need is unavailable, send a test event following the instructions in [Step 2](#step-2-create-a-pixel).
4. Your ad will be displayed in the TikTok feed and search. For additional setup, click **Advanced settings**. In **Placements**, configure the placement settings:
   - **User comment**: Select if you want to display your ad in the comments section as well. TikTok recommends keeping user comments on to help your ads achieve more impressions.
   - **Allow video download**: Allow viewers to download your ad.
   - **Allow video sharing**: Allow viewers to share your ad.
   <ZoomImage id="tiktok-placement.webp" />
5. Click **Continue**.

## Step 5. Add ad content

Now, it's time to set up your creatives and destination URL:

1. In the **TikTok account** field, select an account that will be used for posting.
2. In [Adapty User Acquisition](adapty-user-acquisition.md), [create a web campaign](ua-tiktok.md) and paste **Click link** to the **Destination URL** field.
   <ZoomImage id="tiktok-ad-content.webp" width="700px" />
3. In the **Creatives** section, click **+ Videos and images**.
4. If you want to use your TikTok posts as creatives, select them on the **TikTok post tab**. Otherwise, switch to the **Creative library** tab and click **Upload**. Files you upload there will be accessible from this tab later, so you can reuse them in other campaigns.
   <ZoomImage id="tiktok-add-creatives.webp" width="700px" />
5. Crop the creatives to fit the TikTok format and select whether they will be used as single ads or as one carousel.
6. Expand the upload creative and click **+** next to **No music selected**. You can upload your own mp3 files there. Adding music is required.
7. In the **Add text** field, enter the text that will be used as a description.
8. Select **Place the ads on this TikTok account as a post** if you want to post this ad in your TikTok account.
9. In the **Call to action** field, select or remove calls to action that are relevant to your ad. They will be appended to your ad automatically by TikTok.
   <ZoomImage id="tiktok-ad-text.webp" width="700px" />
10. Click **Continue**.

## Step 6. Configure targeting and budget

Finally, set up who should see your ad and how much you plan to pay for it:

1. In the **Targeting** section, select **Automatic** or **Custom**. The **Automatic** option is the easiest if you don't understand your audience yet. However, if you select **Custom**, you can optimize your spending by selecting those user groups who are more likely to respond to your ad.
2. If you have selected **Custom**, configure:
   - **Location**: The default location is the location of your ad account. If you select more than one targeting country or region, ad review results will be returned separately for each location. Actual ads delivery may also vary depending on the supported locations of different placements. 
   - **Languages**: By default, all languages are selected. Select the targeting language based on the language used most often in your selected location. 
   - **Gender**: By default, all genders are selected.
   :::tip
   If you switch to Full mode, you’ll find an additional **Device** section under **Targeting**. Here you can limit your audience by device type, OS, and OS version—useful if your app requires a minimum version.
   :::
  <ZoomImage id="tiktok-targeting.webp" width="700px" />
3. In the **Budget** section, select one of the suggested options or select **Custom**.
4. If you have selected **Custom**, select whether you need **Daily** or **Lifetime** budget and enter the limit in your currency. **Daily** budget allows you more flexibility while you are still learning, so you can start with smaller amounts and gradually adjust them on the go.
   <ZoomImage id="tiktok-budget.webp" width="700px" />
5. In the **Schedule** section, select **Continue for at least 7 days** or **Custom**. We recommend you to set **Custom** schedule if your ad is time-sensitive, so you don't miss the moment when you need to stop it.
6. If you have selected **Custom**, set the start or start and end time for the ads. Note that your account timezone will be used.
   <ZoomImage id="tiktok-schedule.webp" width="700px" />
7. Click **Publish**.

When you finish, it will create a new campaign with one ad group. The ad group will contain one ad if you have configured a carousel or several ads if you have added creatives as separate ads.

## Step 7. Enter payment details

To start running the ad, after you configure targeting and ad budget, enter your payment details. After that, you are all set!
