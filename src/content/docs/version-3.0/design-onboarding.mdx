The no-code mobile app onboarding builder is a powerful and customizable tool that will help you provide your users with the best onboarding experience. You don't even need to be a developer or designer to get a great result.

## Onboarding screens

The onboarding flow consists of several screens that you add and design.

Users will tap the button to navigate between them.

:::tip
If some of your users need a slightly different flow (for example, in your fitness app, you might want to show different 'goal' pictures based on the user's gender), you don't need to create separate onboardings. 

Instead, you can [make some screens hidden by default and displayed only for some scenarios](onboarding-user-engagement.md).
:::

## Onboarding elements

The onboarding elements are displayed on the left in the order they are displayed. Click **Add** at the top right to add a new element.

There are the following groups of elements you can add:

- **Containers**: Containers allow you to set up a flexible layout. For example, if you want to add a two-column text, you need to add **Columns** and then drag two text blocks into **Columns** on the left pane. Or, if you are adding a carousel, you'll need to add images to the **Media** elements inside.
- **Typography**: Add pre-formatted text blocks and configure their look as needed.
- **Media & Display**: Except for images and videos, you can add animated charts that demonstrate your app value and encourage users. 
  
  The **supported video formats** are MP4 and WebM. The **maximum media file size** is 15 MB.

  If you want to add an unsupported animated element (like Lottie), you can convert it to a video (for example, with [this tool](https://www.lottielab.com/lottie-to-video)) and embed it as a video.
- **Quiz**: Create short questionnaires with text and image options to customize the onboarding experience and get to know your users better.
- **Inputs**: Collect your users' data.
- **Buttons**: Buttons let your users navigate between screens, close the onboarding or move to the paywall. You can also add glossy or moving buttons to attract user's attention and convert their install to a purchase.
- **Loaders**: Animated loaders keep users engaged during the process.
- **User engagement**: Add testimonials, user email lists and countdowns.

:::note
As a part of the **Media & Display** group, you can also add custom HTML code if the provided customization options are not enough. 

However, custom HTML elements are neither preloaded nor cached, so it is recommended to use **Raw HTML** only for small, lightweight elements.

  <img src="/assets/shared/img/design-onboarding4.png"
  style={{
  border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
  width: '700px', /* image width */
  display: 'block', /* for alignment */
  margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
  />
  </Zoom>

### Element ID and action ID

If you want to use a button for custom actions, assign it an **action ID** and then use it in your source code. Action IDs let you handle different buttons with the same action ID in the same way.

  <Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/ios-events-1.webp"
  style={{
  border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
  width: '700px', /* image width */
  display: 'block', /* for alignment */
  margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
  />
  </Zoom>

If you want to process user input in a specific field (e.g., save their age or email), assign it an **element ID** and then use it in your source code to associate questions with answers. Element IDs can be used only once in your onboarding.

  <Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/design-onboarding5.png"
  style={{
  border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
  width: '700px', /* image width */
  display: 'block', /* for alignment */
  margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
  />
  </Zoom>

## Customization options

You have the following customization options in the builder:
- **Styles** tab: Adjust the element's look.
  <Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/design-onboarding1.png"
  style={{
  border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
  width: '700px', /* image width */
  display: 'block', /* for alignment */
  margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
  />
  </Zoom>
- **Element** tab: Set the element’s attributes, such as visibility, actions for pressing buttons or other properties unrelated to the element's look.
  <Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/design-onboarding2.png"
  style={{
  border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
  width: '700px', /* image width */
  display: 'block', /* for alignment */
  margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
  />
  </Zoom>
- **Screen** tab: Set up the general screen configuration, such as a header or displaying a screen counter.
  <Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/design-onboarding3.png"
  style={{
  border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
  width: '700px', /* image width */
  display: 'block', /* for alignment */
  margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
  />
  </Zoom>

## Copy screens and elements

If you've created an onboarding and want to reuse parts of it, or if you want to make slight changes and run A/B tests, you can copy one or more screens from one onboarding to another.

To copy screens, open the onboarding builder and either:
- Right-click a single screen and select **Copy**
- Select the desired screen and press `Ctrl+C` (Windows) or `⌘+C` (Mac)

You can also copy individual elements or text blocks, either within the same onboarding or between different onboardings.

## Copy screens from web-to-app funnels

If you use web-to-app funnels created in [FunnelFox](https://funnelfox.com/) and want to use screens from funnels in onboardings, you can quickly do it by copying screens in the funnel builder and pasting them in the onboarding builder:

1. In the FunnelFox funnel builder, right-click a screen and select **Copy**, or select the screen and press `Ctrl+C`/`⌘+C`.
2. Open the onboarding builder.
3. Right-click the screen where you want to insert the copied screen and select **Paste**, or select it and press `Ctrl+V`/`⌘+V`. The copied screen will be inserted below the selected screen.
