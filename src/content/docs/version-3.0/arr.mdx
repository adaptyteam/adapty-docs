The Annual recurring revenue chart shows revenue from all active auto-renewable subscriptions normalized to one year.   The chart considers any paid, unexpired subscription as active. ARR is a crucial metric for tracking your subscription business's growth and predicting future revenue.

### Calculation

:::warning
The calculator below **does not take into account** [store commission and taxation](how-adapty-analytics-works#tax-and-commission-logic). Compare the result to your **gross revenue** calculations.
:::

ARR represents the predictable, recurring annual income of your subscription business. This metric is only useful when annual subscriptions are the biggest chunk of your sales.  

For each subscription type, divide its price times subscribers by the number of years in the billing period, then add the results together. Enter the values for your subscriptions into the interactive calculator to measure your gross ARR:

<SimpleCalculator client:load
    heading="ARR"
    formuLatex="\sum \frac{P_s \times U_s}{D_y}"
    variables={[
        {
            nameInTheFormula: "P_s",
            variableName: "price",
            variableDescription: "Subscription price",
            variableValue: 240
        },
        {
            nameInTheFormula: "U_s",
            variableName: "subs",
            variableDescription: "Active paid subs",
            variableValue: 2
        },
        {
            nameInTheFormula: "D_y",
            variableName: "periods",
            variableDescription: "Subscription period",
            variableValue: 1,
            options: [
                { label: "Weekly", value: "1/52" },
                { label: "Monthly", value: "1/12" },
                { label: "2 months", value: "2/12" },
                { label: "3 months", value: "3/12" },
                { label: "6 months", value: "6/12" },
                { label: "Annual", value: 1 }
            ]
        }
    ]}
    formulaCalculation="(price * subs ) / periods"
    isSum={true}
    defaultRows={[
        { price: 240, subs: 2, periods: "1" },
        { price: 30, subs: 10, periods: "1/12" },
        { price: 10, subs: 20, periods: "1/52" }
    ]}
/>

For example, there are 2 active annual subscriptions with a price of $240, and 10 monthly subscriptions with a price of $30, and 20 weekly subscriptions with a price of $10,  
ARR = (2 _ $240 / 1) + (10 _ $30 / (1/12)) + (20\*$10 / (1/52)) = $14480

:::note
ARR excludes subscriptions that have been refunded. When a subscription is refunded, it's removed from the MRR calculation for all periods it was active, ensuring that MRR reflects only the recurring revenue from subscriptions that remain valid.

### ARR chart usage

The Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) chart is a valuable tool for measuring the growth and scale of your subscription-based business. It's a widely-used metric that provides a normalized view of your recurring revenue over a 12-month period. To gain a better understanding of what's driving your ARR, you can segment your data by key subscriber segments such as Store or Product Duration. By doing so, you can identify which segments are driving the most revenue, and optimize your business strategy accordingly.
