- Subscriptions/in-app purchases SDK for [iOS](sdk-installation-ios), [Android](sdk-installation-android), [React Native](sdk-installation-reactnative), [Flutter](sdk-installation-flutter), [Unity](sdk-installation-unity), [Capacitor](capacitor-sdk-overview.md), and [Kotlin Multiplatform](sdk-installation-kotlin-multiplatform.md). Adapty performs server-side receipt validation for you and syncs your customers across all platforms, including the [web](getting-started-with-server-side-api). It also works in [Observer mode](observer-vs-full-mode), so you can use SDK without changing your existing purchase infrastructure.

- [Analytics](analytics-charts) for the app economy. Detailed metrics related to your app monetization.
- Adapty can send [subscription events](events) to third party analytics: [Amplitude](amplitude), [AppsFlyer](appsflyer), [Adjust](adjust), [Branch](branch), [Mixpanel](mixpanel), [Facebook Ads](facebook-ads), [AppMetrica](appmetrica), and custom [Webhook](webhook).

### Adapty works for developers, marketers, and executives

Marketers can directly engage users with promotional offers to return them to the service or upsell new products. With Adapty, there is no need for programmers and analysts to manually extract segments.

For product managers and executives, Adapty has a dashboard with viable subscription metrics with daily/weekly/monthly reports to Slack and Emails.
