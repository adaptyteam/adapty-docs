Adapty's integration with Google Cloud Storage allows you to store event and paywall visit data securely in one central location.  You will be able to save your [subscription events](events) to your Google Cloud Storage bucket as .csv files.  
To set up this integration, you will need to follow a few simple steps in the Google Cloud Console and Adapty Dashboard.

:::note
Schedule

Adapty sends your data to Google Cloud Storage every 24h at 4:00 UTC.

Each file will contain data for the events created for the entire previous calendar day in UTC. For example, the data exported automatically at 4:00 UTC on March 8th will contain all the events created on March 7th from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 in UTC.
:::

## How to set up Google Cloud storage integration

To integrate Google Cloud Storage go to [**Integrations** -> **Google Cloud Storage**](https://app.adapty.io/integrations/google-cloud-storage), turn on a toggle from off to on, and fill out fields.

First of all set credentials to build a connection between Google Cloud Storage and Adapty profiles.

## Create Google Cloud Storage credentials

This guide will help you create the necessary credentials in your Google Cloud Platform Console.

In order for Adapty to upload raw data reports to your designated bucket, the service account's key is required, as well as write access to the corresponding bucket. By providing the service account's key and granting write access to the bucket, you allow Adapty to securely and efficiently transfer the raw data reports from its platform to your storage environment.

:::warning
Please note that we only support Service Account HMAC key authorization, means it's essential to ensure that your Service Account HMAC key has the "Storage Object Viewer", "Storage Legacy Bucket Writer" and "Storage Object Creator" roles added to it to enable proper access to Google Cloud Storage.
:::

1. For the first step, you need to go to the [IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) section of your Google Cloud account and choose the relevant project or create a new one. 

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/30a81ef-CleanShot_2023-03-17_at_15.22.142x.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

2. Next, create a new service account for the Adapty by clicking on the "+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT" button.

   

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/98f8ebf-CleanShot_2023-03-17_at_15.40.062x.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

3. Fill out the fields in the first step, as access will be granted at a later stage. In order to read more details about this page read the documentation [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create).

   

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/2190c50-CleanShot_2023-03-17_at_15.48.552x.webp"

    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

4. To create and download a [private JSON key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete), navigate to the KEYS section and click on the "ADD KEY" button.

   

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/8a45468-CleanShot_2023-03-17_at_15.58.092x.webp"
  style={{

    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

5. In the DETAILS section, locate the Email value linked to the recently created service account and make a copy of it. This information will be necessary for the upcoming steps to authorize the account and allow it to write to the bucket.

   

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/6ccd0f0-CleanShot_2023-03-17_at_16.03.162x.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

6. To proceed go to the Google Cloud Storage's[ Buckets](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser) page and either select an existing bucket or create a new one to store the Event or Visuts Data reports from Adapty.  Then navigate to the PERMISSIONS section and select the option to [GRANT ACCESS](https://support.google.com/cloudidentity/answer/9178892?hl=en).

   

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/3cdd937-CleanShot_2023-03-17_at_16.14.232x.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

7. In the PERMISSIONS section, input the Email of the service account obtained in the fifth step mentioned earlier, then choose the Storage Object Creator role. Finally, click on SAVE to apply the changes.

   

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/62801f4-CleanShot_2023-03-17_at_16.17.312x.webp"

    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

      Remember to keep the name of the bucket for future reference.

8. After passing these steps have successfully completed the necessary setup steps in the Google Cloud Console! The final step involves entering the bucket's name, accessing the JSON file containing the downloaded private key, and extracting the required field values for use in Adapty.

  }}
/>
</Zoom>

## Manual data export

In addition to the automatic event data export to Google Cloud Storage, Adapty also provides a manual file export functionality. With this feature, you can select a specific time interval for the event data and export it to your GCS bucket manually. This allows you to have greater control over the data you export and when you export it.

The specified date range will be used to export the events created from Date A 00:00:00 UTC up to Date B 23:59:59 UTC.

## Table structure

In Google Cloud Storage integration, Adapty provides table to store historical data for transaction events and paywall visits. The table contains information about the user profile, revenue and proceeds, and the origin store, among other data points. Essentially, these tables log all transactions generated by an app for a given time period.

:::warning
Note that this structure may grow over time — with new data being introduced by us or by the 3rd parties we work with. Make sure that your code that processes it is robust enough and relies on the specific fields, but not on the structure as a whole.

## Events and tags

You can manage what data is communicated by the integration. The integration offers the following configuration options:

| Setting                            | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exclude Historical Events**      | Opt to exclude events that occurred before the user installed the app with Adapty SDK. This prevents duplication of events and ensures accurate reporting. For instance, if a user activated a monthly subscription on January 10th and updated the app with Adapty SDK on March 6th, Adapty will omit events before March 6th and retain subsequent events. |
| **Include events without profile** | Opt to include transactions that are not linked to a user profile in Adapty. These may include purchases made before Adapty SDK was installed or transactions received from store server notifications that cannot be immediately associated with a specific user. |
| **Send User Attributes**           | If you wish to send user-specific attributes, like language preferences, and your OneSignal plan supports more than 10 tags, select this option. Enabling this allows the inclusion of additional information beyond the default 10 tags. Note that exceeding tag limits may result in errors. |
