Navigation and branching lets you guide users through every step of your onboarding: use static routes to send everyone to core screens, and dynamic navigation to adapt the flow based on user choices. All without writing a single line of code. 

## Set up navigation

You can configure static and dynamic navigation, as well as onboarding closure, using [buttons](onboarding-buttons.md) and [quizzes](onboarding-quizzes.md). 

:::info
For quizzes, only single-answer quizzes are suitable for navigation. Multiple-answer quizzes can be used to set [conditional element visibility](onboarding-element-visibility.md).

### Static navigation

Static navigation directs users to the same target screen. To set it up:
1. Add a button or a single-answer quiz.
2. Select the button or quiz and go to the **Element** tab on the right.
3. Set up the **On Press** button section or **Behaviour** for the quiz:
- **Action on** (for quiz only): Select **Option** to unlock navigation settings for the quiz.
- **Action**: Select **Navigate**.
- **Data**: Select **Static** to direct users to the same target screen.
- **Destination**: Choose the destination screen.

:::note
With static navigation, a quiz directs users to the same screen regardless of the answer they select.

    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

### Dynamic navigation

Dynamic navigation routes users based on their quiz answers:
- **Quiz answers on previous screens**: Both buttons or single-answer quizzes can trigger navigation.
- **Quiz answers on the current screen**: Only single-answer quizzes can trigger navigation.

To set it up:
1. Add a button or a single-answer quiz that will navigate users.
2. Select the button or quiz and go to the **Element** tab on the right.
3. Set up the **On Press** button section or **Behaviour** for the quiz:
- **Action on** (for quiz only): Select **Option** to unlock navigation settings for the quiz.
- **Action**: Select **Navigate**.
- **Data**: Select **Dynamic** to direct users based on their previous quiz answers.
- **State**: Choose a quiz whose answers determine the user destination.
4. Select the destination screen for each quiz option. 

Your button or quiz will dynamically route users to the destinations you configured.

  }}

### Onboarding closure

If your user journey calls for closing the onboarding flow, you can set it up using buttons or single-answer quizzes:

1. Add a button or a single-answer quiz.
2. Select the button or quiz and go to the **Element** tab on the right.
3. Set up the **On Press** button section or **Behaviour** for the quiz:
- **Action on** (for quiz only): Select **Option** to unlock navigation settings for the quiz.
- **Action**: Select **Close onboarding**.
