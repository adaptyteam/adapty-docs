Turn your onboarding into a two‑way conversation: add quizzes in Adapty's no‑code builder to collect preferences, segment users, and [branch flows](onboarding-user-engagement.md#onboarding-flow-branching) based on real‑time answers. You'll be gathering insights in minutes—no code required.

## Add quizzes

You can add various quiz types—text, emoji, or image options—to gather user input:

1. Click **Add** at the top left.
2. Select **Quiz** and choose one:
- **Simple**: A single-select list of text options. Use to segment users by a primary attribute (e.g., “What’s your role?”).
- **Multiple choice**: Allows selecting more than one text option. Ideal for gathering all user interests (e.g., favorite features).
- **Emoji**: Options represented by emojis for quick reactions. Great for fast sentiment checks (e.g., “How excited are you?”).
- **Media picker**: Apload images or videos as selectable choices. Perfect for choices that rely on visuals (e.g., select your favorite theme).
- **Rating**: Users rate on a numerical or star scale. Use to measure satisfaction or confidence (e.g., rate this feature 1–5).
- **Popup question**: Displays a modal question overlay. Excellent for time-sensitive prompts.
3. Set up the quiz on the right:
- **Required**: Make an answer mandatory before users can proceed.
- **Layout**: Choose between list or image tile layouts.
- **Multiple answers**: Allow multi-select (disables navigation options for the quiz).
- **Show checkboxes**: Display checkboxes when multiple answers are enabled.
4. Set up quiz options on the right:
- **Label**: Text displayed for each choice.
- **Value**: The value sent to analytics and webhook payloads.
- **Image type**: Upload media or use emojis.
5. Configure [actions](onboarding-actions.md) to fire when the user selects an option.

### How to design quizzes

Here's a simple quiz setup example.

Let's say you have a recipe app and want to know if your users are vegan or vegetarian, then learn more about their preferences based on their answer.

#### Step 1. Add screens

1. Add a new screen and add a **Quiz** element to it.
   <Zoom>
   <img src="/assets/shared/img/onboarding-user-engagement1.png"
   style={{
   border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
   width: '700px', /* image width */
   display: 'block', /* for alignment */
   margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
   }}
   />
   </Zoom>
2. Add screens for different user groups. In our example, these will collect additional information, so they'll also contain quizzes.
   <Zoom>
   <img src="/assets/shared/img/onboarding-user-engagement2.png"
   style={{
   border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
   width: '700px', /* image width */
   display: 'block', /* for alignment */
   margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
   }}
   />
   </Zoom>
3. Add a final screen to indicate the onboarding is complete, allowing users to go straight to the app.
   <Zoom>
   <img src="/assets/shared/img/onboarding-user-engagement3.png"
   style={{
   border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
   width: '400px', /* image width */
   display: 'block', /* for alignment */
   margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
   }}
   />
   </Zoom>

#### Step 2. Configure navigation

1. To set up dynamic navigation, select the **Options** element on the first quiz screen. In the **Behavior** section, add **Action on Option**. 

    Since we want to redirect users to different screens based on their answers, select **Navigate** as the action, choose **Dynamic** for **Data**, and select your **Options** element in **State**. Then associate each option with a screen.

   <Zoom>
   <img src="/assets/shared/img/onboarding-user-engagement4.png"
   style={{
   border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
   width: '700px', /* image width */
   display: 'block', /* for alignment */
   margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
   }}
   />
   </Zoom>

2. On both conditional screens, configure the navigation button. Since we need to skip the second conditional screen, point the navigation button directly to the screen you want to show next.

:::tip
If you want to customize the onboarding itself based on the quiz answers, see the guide for [navigation](onboarding-navigation-branching#dynamic-navigation) or for [using variables](onboarding-variables.md).

   <Zoom>
   <img src="/assets/shared/img/onboarding-user-engagement5.png"
   style={{
   border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
   width: '700px', /* image width */
   display: 'block', /* for alignment */
   margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
   }}
   />
   </Zoom>

## Quiz customization

Beyond the basic [element layout](onboarding-layout.md#element-layout), you can customize quiz appearance:

1. Select the quiz element on the left.
2. Go to **Styles** in the right menu.
3. Adjust these settings:
- **Options**: Height, padding, background, roundness, border, border color.
- **Text**: Color, font, alignment.
- **Pressed State**: Background, text color, border color.

:::tip
After customizing a quiz element, you can click **Apply styles to all options** below to apply the same styles across all onboarding screens in bulk.

   style={{
   border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
   width: '700px', /* image width */
   display: 'block', /* for alignment */
   margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
   }}
   />
   </Zoom>

## Save quiz answers

You can also process the quiz answers in your app and store them or use them in your application.

To do this, you must handle the quiz response event in the app code. See the guide for your platform:
