Restoring Purchases in both iOS and Android is a feature that allows users to regain access to previously purchased content, such as subscriptions or in-app purchases, without being charged again. This feature is especially useful for users who may have uninstalled and reinstalled the app or switched to a new device and want to access their previously purchased content without paying again.

:::note
In paywalls built with [Paywall Builder](adapty-paywall-builder), purchases are restored automatically without additional code from you. If that's your case — you can skip this step.
:::

To restore a purchase if you do not use the [Paywall Builder](adapty-paywall-builder) to customize the paywall, call `.restorePurchases()` method:

```javascript showLineNumbers
try {
  final profile = await Adapty().restorePurchases();
  if (profile?.accessLevels['YOUR_ACCESS_LEVEL']?.isActive ?? false) {
        // successful access restore      
  }
} on AdaptyError catch (adaptyError) {
  // handle the error
} catch (e) {
}
```

Response parameters:
