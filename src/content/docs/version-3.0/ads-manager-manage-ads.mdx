Apple Ads Manager has a two-way integration with Apple Ads: you get near real-time performance data, and you can create and edit ads directly from the Adapty dashboard in a much more convenient way than in the native UI.

If you create an ad in the native Apple Ads dashboard, it will automatically appear in Apple Ads Manager within 24 hours.

## What are ads

An ad is an ad creative assigned to an [ad group](ads-manager-create-ad-group.md) inside a [campaign](ads-manager-create-campaign.md). You can assign one active ad per ad group. 

## Create ads

Before you start, ensure you have created:

- **Ad group**. You can [create it right in Apple Ads Manager dashboard](ads-manager-create-ad-group.md).
- **Custom product page**. You need to [set it up directly in Apple Ads](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/create-custom-product-pages/configure-multiple-product-page-versions/). It must be approved by App Store before you can use it in your ad.

:::note
If you already have an active ad inside the selected ad group, it will be paused to run the new ad.
:::

To create a new Apple Ads ad:

1. Go to **Ads Manager** from the sidebar menu. On any tab, click **+** above the table and select **Create ad**.

2. Select an app you want to launch the ad for.
3. Select an ad group for the ad.
4. Enter the ad name.
5. Select the ad status. Clear the **Status** checkbox if you want to start running the ad later.

6. Click **Select CPP**. You will see all the custom product pages for your app approved by App Store. You can select only one custom product page.

7. Click **Create ad**.

## Edit ads

:::note
After you have created an ad, you can edit only its name. You can't change its CPP or move it to a different ad group.
:::

To edit an ad name, use any of the following options:

- Click the ad name in **Ads Manager > Ads**. Edit the ad name and click the check mark next to it.
  <ZoomImage id="edit-ad-name.gif" width="500px" />

- Select the checkbox next to the ad name and click **Actions > Edit ad**. Change the ad name and click **Save changes**.
   <ZoomImage id="edit-ad-name.webp" width="500px"/>

:::note
Edits to an ad made directly in Apple Ads sync automatically to Apple Ads Manager, but may take time to show in Apple Ads Manager.
:::

## Launch & pause ads

To launch or pause any ad from Apple Ads Manager, use any of the following options:

- Select or clear the checkbox in the **Status** column in **Ads Manager > Ads**.
  <ZoomImage id="ad-status.webp" width="500px"/>

- Select the checkbox next to the ad name and click **Actions > Edit ad**. Change the ad name and click **Save changes**.
  <ZoomImage id="edit-ad-name.webp" width="500px"/>
