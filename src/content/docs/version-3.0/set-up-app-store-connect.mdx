If you're **building your first iOS app**, you must set up your Apple Developer account and App Store Connect before you integrate Adapty.

:::note
If you already have an Apple Developer account and an app registered in App Store Connect, you can skip this guide and go straight to [Initial integration with the App Store](initial_ios).
:::

## Step 1. Enroll in Apple Developer Program

To distribute apps on the App Store and sell in-app purchases, you must join the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/).

### Choose enrollment type

Apple offers two enrollment types:

|                             | Individual         | Organization                 |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| **Who it's for**            | Solo developers    | Companies, teams, nonprofits |
| **Requires D-U-N-S Number** | No                 | Yes                          |
| **Apps published under**    | Your personal name | Your organization's name     |
| **Team management**         | Not available      | Available                    |

:::tip
If you're enrolling as an organization, you need a **D-U-N-S Number** — a unique nine-digit business identifier from Dun & Bradstreet. You can [check if your organization already has one](https://developer.apple.com/enroll/duns-lookup/) or request a new one — the link is at the bottom of the lookup page. A D-U-N-S Number may take up to 5 business days to receive.

### Enroll

1. Go to the [Apple Developer Program enrollment page](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/).
2. Sign in with your Apple ID. If you don't have one, create it first.
3. Follow the steps for your enrollment type (individual or organization).
4. Pay the annual fee.

After Apple processes your enrollment, you receive access to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com). Enrollment typically takes up to 48 hours. For organizations, it may take longer if D-U-N-S verification is required.

## Step 2. Set up your app in App Store Connect

Before you can sell in-app purchases, complete the initial setup in App Store Connect. This includes signing agreements, adding payment details, and registering your app.

### Sign the Paid Applications Agreement

Apple requires you to sign the Paid Applications Agreement before you can sell on the App Store. This applies to both paid apps and in-app purchases in free apps.

1. Go to the **Business** page in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/business).
2. Find the **Paid Apps** agreement and click **Review and Agree**.
3. Complete the required information:
   - **Banking information**: Add a bank account where Apple will send your earnings.
   - **Tax information**: Fill in the tax forms for the countries where you want to sell.
   - **Contact information**: Provide your contact details.

:::important
You must complete all three sections (banking, tax, contact) for the agreement to become active. Until the agreement is active, you cannot sell in-app purchases.
:::

### Create a Bundle ID

A Bundle ID uniquely identifies your app across the Apple ecosystem. You need it to register your app in App Store Connect and to configure the Adapty integration.

1. Open the [Apple Developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account).
2. Go to **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** → **Identifiers**.
3. Click **+** to register a new identifier.
4. Select **App IDs** and click **Continue**.
5. Select **App** as the type and click **Continue**.
6. Fill in the fields:
   - **Description**: A name to help you identify this Bundle ID (e.g., "My Subscription App").
   - **Bundle ID**: Choose **Explicit** and enter a unique identifier in reverse-domain format (e.g., `com.yourcompany.yourapp`).
7. In the **Capabilities** section, scroll down and check **In-App Purchase**.
8. Click **Continue**, then **Register**.

### Register your app in App Store Connect

1. Go to the **Apps** page in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps).
2. Click **+** → **New App**.
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Platforms**: Select **iOS**.
   - **Name**: Your app's name as it will appear on the App Store.
   - **Primary language**: The default language for your app's metadata.
   - **Bundle ID**: Select the Bundle ID you created in the previous step.
   - **SKU**: A unique identifier for your app (not visible to users). For example, `my_subscription_app_2025`.
4. Click **Create**.

Your app is now registered in App Store Connect and ready for the Adapty integration.
