Adapty determines deliverability based on the HTTP status code, considering any response outside the `200-399` range as a failure.

You can track the status of integration events in the **Event List** within the Adapty Dashboard. The system displays statuses for all enabled integrations, regardless of whether a specific event type is turned on for a given integration.

- Black: The event was successfully sent.
- <span style={{ color: 'grey' }}>Grey:</span> The event type is disabled for this integration.
- <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>Red:</span> There is an issue with the integration that requires attention.

For more details on failed events, hover over the integration name to see a tooltip with specific error information.

The **Event Feed** displays data from the past two weeks to optimize performance. This limitation improves page loading speed, making it easier for users to navigate and analyze events efficiently.
