Google Play's [Reduced Service Fee program](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/112622?hl=en) lowers the commission on your first US$1 million in yearly earnings from 30% to **15%**. Earnings above US$1 million in the same calendar year are charged at the standard 30% rate. In regions with [User Choice Billing](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13821247?hl=en), transactions through an alternative billing provider receive a further 4 percentage point reduction.

:::note
Since January 1, 2022, Google charges 15% on all auto-renewable subscriptions regardless of this program. The Reduced Service Fee primarily benefits non-subscription in-app purchases and paid apps.
:::

Enrollment is **not automatic** — you must set up an Account Group and accept the program terms. After you enroll, you must [change your Adapty settings](#configure-adapty) to account for the reduced commission.

This article describes the eligibility requirements, the enrollment process, and the [settings you need to change](#configure-adapty) in Adapty.

Adapty also supports the Small Business Program for the App Store. For details, see [App Store Small Business Program](app-store-small-business-program).

## Eligibility requirements

Google determines eligibility based on your **yearly earnings** across all accounts in your <InlineTooltip tooltip="Account Group">A group of developer accounts whose earnings are counted together. You must designate your Developer Account as the Primary Developer Account and link any associated accounts to the group.</InlineTooltip>.

The 15% rate applies to the first US$1 million in combined annual earnings. Any earnings above that threshold are charged at 30%.

## Enroll in the program

#### Before you enroll

Make sure that you:

- Have a [payment profile](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10632485) set up
- Can list all your Associated Developer Accounts

#### Enrollment

1. Go to the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/).
2. Create an Account Group and set your Developer Account as the Primary Developer Account.
3. Link any Associated Developer Accounts to the group.
4. Accept the Reduced Service Fee program terms.

After you complete these steps, Google automatically enrolls you. No review period or approval email is required. For detailed instructions, see Google's [enrollment guide](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10632485).

Once enrolled, configure Adapty.

## Configure Adapty

Google doesn't automatically share your Reduced Service Fee status with Adapty. To ensure correct revenue calculation and event handling, specify this status on a per-app basis.

:::warning
Configure your Reduced Service Fee status in Adapty **as soon as you enroll**.

If you do it later, Adapty will not repeat webhook calls and integration events for your past transactions.
:::

Open [**App Settings** → **General**](https://app.adapty.io/account), and find the **Reduced Service Fee** section. Click **Add period**.

In the **Period** field, select a date range that matches your program membership start and end dates. You can modify the end date if your [annual earnings exceed US$1 million](#exceeding-the-threshold).

Check the **at the current moment** box to extend your membership status indefinitely.

To verify your configuration, open the [Revenue chart](revenue) and select **Proceeds after store commission**. Confirm that the displayed proceeds reflect the reduced commission rate.

## Exceeding the threshold

When your combined annual earnings surpass US$1 million, Google charges 30% on the portion above the threshold for the rest of that calendar year.

:::important
If your annual earnings exceed US$1 million, **immediately change the exit date** in your Adapty settings. Otherwise, Adapty will continue to calculate commission at the reduced rate.
:::

The program resets each calendar year. If your earnings exceed US$1 million in one year, the 15% rate automatically applies again to your first US$1 million the following year. No re-enrollment is required.
