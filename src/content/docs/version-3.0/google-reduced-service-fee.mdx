Google Play's [Reduced Service Fee program](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/112622?hl=en) lowers the commission on your first 1 million USD in yearly earnings from 30% to **15%**. Earnings above 1 million USD in the same calendar year are charged at the standard 30% rate.

:::note
Since January 1, 2022, Google charges 15% on all auto-renewable subscriptions regardless of this program. The Reduced Service Fee primarily benefits non-subscription in-app purchases and paid apps.
:::

Program members must **change their Adapty settings** to ensure correct revenue calculations and integration event handling.

This article describes:
* [How to set up Adapty](#configure-adapty) if your app is enrolled in the Reduced Service Fee program
* [How to enroll in the program](#enroll-in-the-program) if you want to reduce your store commission

## Configure Adapty

Adapty can apply the reduced commission rate to your [analytics](analytics) and [integration events](analytics-integration). To enable this, specify your Reduced Service Fee status on a per-app basis.

:::warning
Configure your Reduced Service Fee status in Adapty **as soon as you enroll**.

If you retroactively reduce the commission rate, Adapty will change the analytics data, but won't repeat past transactions' webhooks and integration events.
:::

1. Open [**App Settings** → **General**](https://app.adapty.io/account).
2. Find the **Reduced Service Fee** section.
3. Click **Add period**.
4. Select the membership start date.
5. Select an end date, or enable the **At the current moment** checkmark to indefinitely extend this status. If your [annual earnings exceed 1 million USD](#exceeding-the-threshold), you can modify the end date.
6. Click **Apply**.

The membership status only applies **to the date range you specify**. The program resets each calendar year.

* To extend this status indefinitely, enable the **At the current moment** checkmark.

To verify your configuration, open the [Revenue chart](revenue) and select **Proceeds after store commission**. Confirm that the displayed proceeds reflect the reduced commission rate.

## Enroll in the program

### Eligibility requirements

Google determines eligibility based on your **yearly earnings** across all accounts in your <InlineTooltip tooltip="Account Group">A group of developer accounts whose earnings are counted together. You must designate your Developer Account as the Primary Developer Account and link any associated accounts to the group.</InlineTooltip>.

The 15% rate applies to the first 1 million USD in combined annual earnings. Any earnings above that threshold are charged at 30%.

### Before you enroll

Make sure that you:

- Have a [payment profile](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10632485) set up
- Can list all your Associated Developer Accounts

### Enrollment

1. Go to the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/).
2. Create an Account Group and set your Developer Account as the Primary Developer Account.
3. Link any Associated Developer Accounts to the group.
4. Accept the Reduced Service Fee program terms.

After you complete these steps, Google automatically enrolls you. There's no manual review or approval email. For detailed instructions, see Google's [enrollment guide](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10632485).

### Exceeding the threshold

When your combined annual earnings surpass 1 million USD, Google charges 30% on the portion above the threshold for the rest of that calendar year.

:::important
If your annual earnings exceed 1 million USD, **immediately change the exit date** in your Adapty settings. Otherwise, Adapty will continue to calculate commission at the reduced rate.
:::

The program resets each calendar year. If your earnings exceed 1 million USD in one year, the 15% rate automatically applies again to your first 1 million USD the following year. No re-enrollment is required. Read the [official program terms](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/112622?hl=en) for more details.
