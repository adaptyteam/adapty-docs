## Google's 15% Reduced Service Fee

Developers who earn less than $1,000,000 USD annually are eligible to join a reduced service fee tier offered by Google. Under this tier, the commission fee is lowered to 15% instead of the standard rate of 30%. Developers offering automatically renewing subscription products are eligible for a reduced service fee of 15%, independent of their participation in other programs offered by Google Play. You can read more about the service fees [here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/112622?hl=en).

To participate in the Google Play Reduced Service Fee program, you must have a payment profile and create an Account Group where your Developer Account is the Primary Developer Account. You also need to inform Google if you have any Associated Developer Accounts (ADAs) and link your account to the group. Once these steps are completed, you will automatically be enrolled in the program, and you'll be eligible for the reduced commission rate on your first $1,000,000 USD in revenue per year. For more detailed information on the necessary steps, please refer to Google's [documentation](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10632485).

## How Adapty calculates the proceeds Play Store

Adapty can accurately calculate your app's earnings by deducting Google's commissions and taking into account your eligibility for the Reduced Service Fee program.

In the Adapty Dashboard, the Reduced Service Fee membership status is assigned to each individual app based on the developer's representation of multiple apps from different companies in their account. This means that the eligibility for the program is determined on a per-app basis.

You can add multiple periods by selecting a range of dates for each period in the same field. The date range represents the start and end date of the period during which your business was a member of the Small Business Program. Please note that the Entry Date refers to the earliest date in the range when your business became a member of the program, and the Exit Date refers to the latest date in the range when your business officially left or was removed from the program.

You can select your entry date according to your preference. However, it's important to note that if you select a past date, any webhooks and integration events already processed will not be resent with corrected pricing data. To ensure the accuracy of pricing data sent to your integrations, it's advisable to set your effective entry date as soon as possible. This way, you can receive reliable and up-to-date information on your transactions and make informed decisions accordingly.
