Adapty SDK v.3.0 brings support for the new exciting [Adapty Paywall Builder](adapty-paywall-builder), the new version of the no-code user-friendly tool to create paywalls. With its maximum flexibility and rich design capabilities, your paywalls will become most effective and profitable.

## Upgrade process

The upgrade process for Unity involves the same steps as other platforms:

1. Upgrade to Adapty SDK v3.x
2. Migrate your existing paywalls to the new Paywall Builder

For detailed Unity-specific migration instructions, please refer to the [Unity SDK installation guide](sdk-installation-unity) and follow the general migration steps outlined in the main migration guide.
