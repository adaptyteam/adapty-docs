### Calculation

Adapty's calculation logic for the Non-subscriptions chart involves counting the number of in-app purchases made by users that are classified as consumables, non-consumables, and non-renewing subscriptions. This chart excludes renewable payments such as auto-renewing subscriptions.

- Consumables are items that users can purchase multiple times, such as fish food in a fishing app, or extra in-game currency. 
- Non-consumables are items that users can purchase once and use forever, such as a race track in a game app, or ad-free versions of an app. 
- Non-renewing subscriptions are subscriptions that expire after a set period of time and do not renew automatically, such as a one-year subscription to a catalog of archived articles. The content of this in-app purchase can be static, but the subscription will not renew automatically once it expires. 

:::note
This chart counts only purchase events and does not subtract refunded purchases. If you have non-subscription products that are frequently refunded, the displayed count will be higher than the actual number of purchases that generated revenue.
