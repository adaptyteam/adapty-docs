## Other issues

If you haven't found a solution yet, the next steps can be:

- **Upgrading the SDK to the latest version**: We always recommend upgrading to the latest SDK versions since they are more stable and include fixes for known issues.
- **Contact the support team via [support@adapty.io](mailto:support@adapty.io) or via the chat**: If you are not ready to upgrade the SDK or it didn't help, contact our support team. Note that your issue will be resolved faster if you [enable verbose logging](sdk-installation-flutter#logging) and share logs with the team. You can also attach relevant code snippets.
