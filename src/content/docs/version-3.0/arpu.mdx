ARPU (average revenue per user) chart displays the average revenue generated per user for a given period. This metric is calculated by dividing the total revenue generated by a cohort of customers by the number of users in that cohort.

### Calculation

:::warning
The calculator below **does not take into account** [store commission and taxation](how-adapty-analytics-works#tax-and-commission-logic). Compare the result to your **gross revenue** calculations.
:::

Adapty calculates the ARPU chart by dividing the total revenue earned over a given period by the number of non-unique users (installs) during the same period. 

ARPU = Revenue / Number of new users


<CompoundCalculator client:load
    heading="ARPU"
    formuLatex="\frac{\sum P_i \times Q_i}{U_p}"
    variables={[
        {
            nameInTheFormula: "P",
            variableName: "price",
            variableDescription: "Price per unit",
            variableValue: 10
        },
        {
            nameInTheFormula: "Q",
            variableName: "qty",
            variableDescription: "Quantity",
            variableValue: 1
        },
        {
            nameInTheFormula: "Up",
            variableName: "users",
            variableDescription: "Total users",
            variableValue: 160,
            global: true
        }
    ]}
    rowFormula="price * qty"
    resultFormula="_sum / users"
    defaultRows={[
        { price: 10, qty: 5 },
        { price: 50, qty: 10 },
        { price: 100, qty: 1 }
    ]}
/>
For instance, if your app generated $10,000 in revenue over the course of a week, and had 2,000 non-unique users during that same period, the ARPU for that week would be $5 ($10,000/2,000). 

The calculation is done before the store's fee, and the refund amount is excluded from the revenue.

### ARPU chart usage

ARPU chart usage is beneficial for businesses to track their overall revenue generation and understand how much revenue is being generated per user. By analyzing the ARPU chart, businesses can identify trends, patterns, and areas of improvement to optimize their revenue generation strategies. This can help businesses make data-driven decisions to increase their user engagement, target their marketing efforts, and improve their overall monetization strategy.
