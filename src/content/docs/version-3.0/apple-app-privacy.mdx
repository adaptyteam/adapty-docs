Apple requires a privacy disclosure for all new apps and app updates both in the **App Privacy** section of App Store Connect and as the app manifest file. Adapty is a third-party dependency to your app, so you need to disclose how you use Adapty in relation to user data.

## Apple app privacy manifest

The [privacy manifest file](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_data_use_in_privacy_manifests), named `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`, describes what private data your app uses and why. You as every app owner must create a manifest file for your app. Additionally, if you're integrating any extra SDKs, ensure the manifest files for those of them included in the [SDKs that require a privacy manifest and signature](https://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements/) list are included. When you build your app, Xcode will take all these manifest files and merge them into one.

Even though Adapty isn't on the list of [SDKs that require a privacy manifest and signature](https://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements/), versions 2.10.2 and higher of the Adapty SDK include it for your convenience. Make sure to update the SDK to get the manifest.

While Adapty doesn't require any data to be included in the manifest file also called app privacy report, if you're using Adapty's ` customerUserId` for tracking, it's necessary to specify it in your manifest file like so: 

1. Add a dictionary to the `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes` array in your privacy information file. 
2. Add the `NSPrivacyCollectedDataType`, `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeLinked`, and `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeTracking` keys to the dictionary.
3. Add string `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeUserID` (identifier of the `UserID` data type in the [List of data categories and types to be reported in the manifest file](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_data_use_in_privacy_manifests#4250555)) for the `NSPrivacyCollectedDataType` key in your `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes` dictionary.
4. Add `true` for the `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeTracking` and `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeLinked` keys in your `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes` dictionary.
5. Use the `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypePurposeProductPersonalization` string as the value for the `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypePurposes` key in your `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes` dictionary.

If you target your paywalls to audiences with custom attributes, consider carefully what custom attributes you use and if they match the [data categories and types to be reported in the manifest file](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_data_use_in_privacy_manifests#4250555). If so, repeat the steps above for every data type.

After you report all data types and categories you collect, create your app's privacy report as described in [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_data_use_in_privacy_manifests#4239187).

### Data types

The table below lists data types that Apple requires you to disclose and indicates which ones Adapty needs. **This only covers Adapty.** If your app collects additional data through other SDKs or your own code, select those data types as well.

✅ = Required by Adapty

👀 = May be required \(see details below\)

❌ = Not required by Adapty — select if your app collects this data through other means

### Required data types

#### Purchases

When using Adapty, you must disclose that your app collects **Purchase History**.

         style={{
             border: 'none', /* border width and color */
             width: '700px', /* image width */
             display: 'block', /* for alignment */
             margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
         }}
    />
</Zoom>

#### Identifiers

When using Adapty, you must disclose the following identifiers:
- **Device ID** — Adapty collects IDFA.
- **User ID** — required if you identify users with **`customerUserId`**.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/93f3daa-CleanShot_2023-08-25_at_12.35.272x.webp"
  style={{
    border: 'none', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

### Data usage

After saving **Data types**, you'll need to indicate how the data is used:

1. Click **Set up purchase history** inside the **Purchases** block.

    <Zoom>
        <img src="/assets/shared/img/purchase-privacy.webp"
        style={{
        border: 'none', /* border width and color */
        width: '700px', /* image width */
        display: 'block', /* for alignment */
        margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
    }}
        />
    </Zoom>

2. When Apple asks how purchase history data is used, select the following for Adapty:
    - **Analytics** — Adapty uses purchase history for revenue analytics, cohorts, and metrics.
    - **Product Personalization** — Adapty uses purchase data for audience segmentation and paywall targeting.
    - **App Functionality** — Adapty validates purchases, manages access levels, and tracks subscription status.

    Select additional purposes if your app uses purchase data in other ways (for example, if you send purchase events to ad platforms via Adapty integrations).

    <Zoom>
        <img src="/assets/shared/img/purchase-history.webp"
        style={{
        border: 'none', /* border width and color */
        width: '700px', /* image width */
        display: 'block', /* for alignment */
        margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
    }}
        />
    </Zoom>

3. Click **Next**.
4. For both **Device ID** and **User ID** (if used):
    1. Click **Set up user/device ID** inside the **User/Device ID** block.
    2. When Apple asks how identifier data is used, select the following for Adapty:
        - **App Functionality** — Adapty uses identifiers to manage user profiles, link purchases, and track access levels.
       If you send attribution data to third-party platforms via Adapty integrations (such as AppsFlyer or Adjust), also select **Third-Party Advertising**. Select additional purposes if your app uses identifiers in other ways.
