The New subscriptions chart displays the amount of new (first-time activated) subscriptions in your app. This metric shows the number of new subscriptions starting in a specific time period, including both subscriptions that start from scratch and free trials that convert into paid subscriptions. It does not include subscription renewals or subscriptions that have been restarted.

### Calculation

Adapty's calculation logic for the New subscriptions chart counts the number of new (first-time activated) subscriptions during a given period, including both subscriptions that start from scratch and free trials that convert into paid subscriptions. At a daily resolution, the count of new subscriptions represents the number of new subscriptions activated on that day. Therefore, the count of new subscriptions for a given day indicates the number of new subscriptions activated on that day. At a monthly resolution, the count of new subscriptions represents the number of new subscriptions activated during that month.

:::note
The New subscriptions count includes all subscriptions that were initially activated during the period, even if they were later refunded. This means the displayed count may be higher than the number of subscriptions that ultimately generated revenue. To understand the net impact, compare this metric with the Refund events chart.
