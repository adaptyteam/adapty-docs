Adapting your paywalls for different languages is essential in a world with diverse cultures. Localization allows you to create tailored experiences for users in specific regions. For each paywall, you can add versions in various languages, ensuring that your product resonates with local audiences.

If you are not using the Adapty Paywall Builder to design paywalls, you can still localize your custom paywalls and manage localizations without redeploying your app:

1. You create a remote config with variables in the Adapty dashboard. Variables can stand either for text, media, or other content types.
2. You set up variable values for each locale.
3. You handle variables in the app code.
4. When you get a paywall with products and send a locale, you get proper variable values.

This way, localizations are not hardcoded in the app code, and you can adjust them anytime

Whether in table view or JSON format, you can easily adjust settings for each language. For example, translate string keys, toggle Boolean values (e.g., `TRUE` for English, `FALSE` for Italian), or even swap out background images.

## Set up localization for remote configured paywalls

1. Go to the [**Paywalls**](https://app.adapty.io/paywalls) section in Adapty.
2. Click the paywall to open it.
3. Go to the **Remote config** tab.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/switch_to_remote_config.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

4. Click **Locales** and select the languages you want to support. Save your changes to add these locales to the paywall.

   

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/add_locale.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

Now, you can translate the content manually, use AI, or export the localization file for external translators.

## Translate paywalls with AI

AI-powered translation is a quick and efficient way to localize your paywall.

:::note

To use AI for paywall translation, you’ll need a Pro, Pro+, or Enterprise plan.

:::

You can translate both **String** and **List** values. By default, all lines are selected (highlighted in violet). Lines that have already been translated are marked in green and won’t be included in the new translation by default. Lines that are not selected or translated appear in gray.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/localization-table.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/localization-json.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

1. Select the lines to translate. It's a good idea to uncheck lines with IDs, URLs, and variables to prevent AI from translating them.

2. Select the languages for translation.

   <Zoom>
     <img src="/assets/shared/img/localization-table-language.webp"
     style={{
       border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
       width: '700px', /* image width */
       display: 'block', /* for alignment */
       margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
     }}
   />
   </Zoom>

3. Click **AI Translate** to apply translations. The selected lines will be translated and added to the paywall, with the translated lines marked green.

## Exporting localization files for external translation

While AI-powered localization is becoming a popular trend, you might prefer a more reliable method, like using professional human translators or a translation agency with a strong track record. If that’s the case, you can export localization files to share with your translators and then import the translated results back into Adapty.

Exporting by the **Export** button creates individual `.json` files for each language, bundled into a single archive. If you only need one file, you can export it directly from the language-specific menu.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/localization-single-export.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

Once you’ve received the translated files, use the **Import** button to upload them all at once or individually. Adapty will automatically validate the files to ensure they match the correct format.

### Import file format

To ensure a successful import, the import file must meet the following requirements:

- **File Name and Extension:**
  The file name must match the locale it represents and have a `.json` extension. You can verify and copy the locale name in the Adapty Dashboard. If the name is not recognized, the import will fail.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/locale-name.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

- **Valid JSON:**
  The file must be a valid JSON. If it is not, the import will fail.

## Manual localization

Sometimes, you might want to tweak translations, add different images for specific locales, or even adjust remote configurations directly.

1. Choose the element you want to translate and type in a new value. You can update both **String** and **List** values or replace images with those better suited for the locale.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/032b429-remote_config_localization.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

2. Take advantage of the context menu in the English locale to resolve localization issues efficiently:

   - **Copy this value to all locales**: Overwrites any changes made in non-English locales for the selected row, replacing them with the value from the English locale.

   - **Revert all row changes to original values**: Discards any changes made during the current session and restores the values to their last saved state.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/d7e70f1-remote_confi_loc_table_options.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>

After adding locales to a paywall, make sure to implement locale codes correctly in your app's code.
