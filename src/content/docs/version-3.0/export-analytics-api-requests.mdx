Exporting your analytics data to CSV gives you the flexibility to dive deeper into your app’s performance metrics, customize reports, and analyze trends over time. With the Adapty API, you can easily pull detailed analytics into a CSV format, making it convenient to track, share, and refine your data insights as needed.

## Postman collection and environment

To simplify using our API for exporting analytics data, we've prepared a Postman collection and an environment file you can download and import into Postman.

- **Request Collection**: Includes all requests available in the Adapty analytics export API. Note that it uses variables that you can define in the environment.
- **Environment**: Contains a list of variables where you can define values once. We've prepared a unified environment for the server-side API, web API, and analytics export API to make things easier for you. After making this environment active, Postman will automatically substitute the defined variable values in your requests.
