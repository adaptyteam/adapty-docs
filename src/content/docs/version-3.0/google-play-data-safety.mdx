The Data Safety section available on Google Play provides a simple method for app developers to inform users about the data collected or shared by their app, as well as highlight their app's critical privacy and security measures. This information enables users to make more informed decisions when selecting which apps to download and use.

Here is a short guide on data that Adapty collects to help you provide the required information to Google Play.

## Data Collection and Security

**Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types?**  
Select 'Yes' as Adapty collects a customer's purchase history.

**Is all of the user data collected by your app encrypted in transit?**  
Select 'Yes' as  Adapty encrypts data in transit.

**Do you provide a way for users to request that their data is deleted?**  
If selecting 'Yes', ensure your customers have a way to contact your support team to request a data deletion. You will be able to delete the customer directly from the Adapty dashboard or via REST API.
