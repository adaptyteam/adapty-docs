The Refund events chart shows how many purchases and subscriptions were refunded. Adapty ties each refund event to the date the refund was issued, not to the subscription start date.

### Calculation

Adapty counts every purchase or subscription refunded within the selected period. Each refund is attributed to the date it happened, not to when the subscription began. Refunds for trials are excluded because trials generate no revenue.

### Available filters and grouping

- ✅ Filter by: Attribution, country, paywall, store, product, duration, and refund reason. 
- ✅ Group by: Product, country, store, paywall, duration, refund reason, attribution status, attribution channel, attribution campaign, attribution ad group, attribution ad set, and attribution creative.

You can find more information about the available controls, filters, grouping options, and how to use them in the [detailed guide](controls-filters-grouping-compare-proceeds).

### Refund events chart usage

Use the Refund events chart to spot refund spikes and recurring issues. Tracking refunds over time helps you detect patterns and take actions that reduce churn and protect revenue.

### Similar metrics
