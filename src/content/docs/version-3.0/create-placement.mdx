A [Placement](placements) is a specific location in your mobile app where you can show a paywall, onboarding, or A/B test. For example, a subscription choice might appear in a startup flow, while a consumable product (like golden coins) could show when a user runs out of coins in a game.

You can show the same or different paywalls, onboardings, or A/B tests in various placements or to different user segments — called "audiences" in Adapty.

Read the [Choose meaningful placements](choose-meaningful-placements) section for tips on picking the right placement.

:::info
Although the placement creation process is similar for paywalls and onboardings, you can't create one placement for both as they process different metrics.

## Create and configure a placement

1. Go to **[Placements](https://app.adapty.io/placements)** from the Adapty main menu.

2. Click **Create placement**.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/create-placement-2.png"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

3. Enter a **Placement name**. This is an internal identifier in the Adapty Dashboard. You can edit it later if needed.

4. Enter a **Placement ID**. You'll use this ID in the Adapty SDK to call the placement's [paywalls](paywalls), [onboardings](onboardings), and [A/B tests](ab-tests). You cannot edit it later as it's unique for each placement.

Next, assign a paywall, onboarding, or A/B test to the placement. Adapty supports [audiences](audience) — user segments based on [segments](segments.md) — so you can show different content to different user groups. If you don't need targeting, the default *All users* audience covers everyone.

<AddAudience />

Once your placement is saved and published, you have everything you need — use the **Placement ID** in your app code to fetch and display it.
