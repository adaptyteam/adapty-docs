If you are building paywalls using the Adapty paywall builder, it's crucial to set up buttons properly:

1. Add a [button in the paywall builder](paywall-buttons.md) and assign it either a pre-existing action or create a custom action ID.
2. Write code in your app to handle each action you've assigned.

This guide shows how to handle custom and pre-existing actions in your code.

## Close paywalls

To add a button that will close your paywall:

1. In the paywall builder, add a button and assign it the **Close** action.
2. In your app code, implement a handler for the `close` action that dismisses the paywall.

:::info
In the Capacitor SDK, the `close` action triggers closing the paywall by default. However, you can override this behavior in your code if needed. For example, closing one paywall might trigger opening another.
:::

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { adapty, createPaywallView } from '@adapty/capacitor';

const view = await createPaywallView(paywall);

const unsubscribe = view.setEventHandlers({
  onCloseButtonPress() {
    console.log('User closed paywall');
    return true; // Allow the paywall to close
  }
});
```

## Open URLs from paywalls

:::tip
If you want to add a group of links (e.g., terms of use and purchase restoration), add a **Link** element in the paywall builder and handle it the same way as buttons with the **Open URL** action.
:::

To add a button that opens a link from your paywall (e.g., **Terms of use** or **Privacy policy**):

1. In the paywall builder, add a button, assign it the **Open URL** action, and enter the URL you want to open.
2. In your app code, implement a handler for the `openUrl` action that opens the received URL in a browser.

:::info
In the Capacitor SDK, the `window.open` action triggers opening the URL by default. However, you can override this behavior in your code if needed.
:::

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { adapty, createPaywallView } from '@adapty/capacitor';

const view = await createPaywallView(paywall);

const unsubscribe = view.setEventHandlers({
  onUrlPress(url) {
    window.open(url, '_blank');
    return false; // Don't close the paywall
  },
});
```

## Log into the app

To add a button that logs users into your app:

1. In the paywall builder, add a button and assign it the **Login** action.
2. In your app code, implement a handler for the `login` action that identifies your user.

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { adapty, createPaywallView } from '@adapty/capacitor';

const view = await createPaywallView(paywall);

const unsubscribe = view.setEventHandlers({
  onCustomAction(actionId) {
    if (actionId === 'login') {
      // Navigate to login screen
      console.log('User requested login');
    }
  }
});
```

## Handle custom actions

To add a button that handles any other actions:

1. In the paywall builder, add a button, assign it the **Custom** action, and assign it an ID.
2. In your app code, implement a handler for the action ID you've created.

For example, if you have another set of subscription offers or one-time purchases, you can add a button that will display another paywall:

```typescript showLineNumbers
const unsubscribe = view.setEventHandlers({
  onCustomAction(actionId) {
    if (actionId === 'openNewPaywall') {
      // Display another paywall
      console.log('User requested new paywall');
    }
  },
});
```
