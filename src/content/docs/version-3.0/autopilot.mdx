:::tip
Growth Autopilot works best with apps that already generate revenue. If Adapty can analyze your financial metrics, its suggestions are more likely to be effective.
:::

Your app growth primarily relies on the following factors:
- Pricing strategy
- Paywall design
- Discounts and upsells

Your pricing strategy should be based on the market, so it's important to see how competitors set their prices. This helps you spot trends, find gaps, and make smart decisions to improve your pricing and stand out.

So, you need to understand **which prices to set** and **which paywalls to launch**. Adapty Growth Autopilot helps you automate these tasks:

1. It picks the live paywall with the most revenue from your largest placement. If your app hasn't generated much revenue yet, choose the placement and paywall you want to analyze manually.
2. It compares your prices and funnel effectiveness to top competitors and industry benchmarks.
3. Based on the results, it creates a testing strategy for pricing, paywall design, and A/B tests.

## Run the analysis

:::important
Before you start, consider the following:
- To provide a single, consistent point of comparison, this analysis is based on the U.S. App Store. This allows us to benchmark all apps against the same large dataset, with prices shown in USD.
- This analysis focuses only on subscription products. Consumable in-app purchases are not included.
:::

1. Go to **A/B tests** from the dashboard sidebar and click **Adapty autopilot**.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/pricing-analysis.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

<br/>

2. Adapty automatically selects the top-performing placement based on revenue data. If you'd like to analyze a different placement, select one from the **Placement** dropdown. Click **Analyze this placement**. Adapty will need some time to analyze your app — don't leave the page, it won't take long.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/select-placement.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '500px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

3. Review your paywall. Adapty selects the top-performing live paywall for analysis. If you wish to analyze a different paywall, click **Change Paywall** and pick another option. You can only select a paywall from the placement chosen in the previous step. When ready, click **Go to competitors research**.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/autopilot-select-paywall.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

4. Adapty suggests up to five competitors based on your app's category and MRR. You can modify the list and manually add apps with an App Store link. We recommend selecting apps with higher MRR than yours. Click **Generate report** to confirm the list.

<Zoom>

    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}

Your report is now ready. See [Your report](#your-report) for a walkthrough of each section.

## Your report

The report analyzes your pricing strategy from several angles. Each section below explains what the data means and how to act on it.

### Paywall overview

The paywall overview shows key metrics for the paywall Autopilot selected for analysis:

- **Active products**: The subscription products attached to this paywall
- **Conversion metrics**: How effectively the paywall converts users
- **Revenue by country**: A chart showing how revenue is distributed across your top markets

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/autopilot-select-paywall.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

### Competitor comparison

This section compares your pricing, subscription structures, and conversion funnel to competitors and industry benchmarks.

Use it to spot where you're underpriced, overpriced, or missing offer types that similar apps use successfully.

By default, results are displayed for the US market. To see how competitors price in other markets, use the country dropdown at the top. The dropdown includes your top 5 countries by revenue.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/compare.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

### Global pricing opportunities

This section helps you identify which countries offer the highest revenue potential.

Adapty shows your next top 5 markets (excluding your main country) and provides data-driven pricing recommendations validated by the [Adapty Pricing Index](https://uploads.adapty.io/adapty_pricing_index.pdf).

At the top, you'll see your **Global average baseline** — the average percentage of users who convert from install to paid worldwide. Adapty uses this baseline to identify abnormal demand in specific regions.

For each country, Adapty shows:
- **Conversion rate**: How this country's install-to-paid rate compares to your global average. A higher rate suggests users convert easily — the price might be too low for the value they see. A lower rate suggests users hesitate — the price may be a barrier.
- **Purchasing power**: Categorized as High, Medium, or Low based on the Adapty Pricing Index, which compares real transaction data from this country against the US benchmark. Low purchasing power means the market requires significant discounts (Index < 0.6). High means users typically pay prices equal to or above the US level (Index ≥ 0.9).

Based on these metrics, you'll receive one of three recommendations for each country:
- **Increase price**: High conversion rate suggests room to capture more revenue
- **Decrease price**: Lower conversion rate indicates price sensitivity
- **Keep price**: Current pricing is well-balanced for this market

             border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
             width: '700px', /* image width */
             display: 'block', /* for alignment */
             margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
         }}
    />
</Zoom>

### Growth plan

Instead of testing everything at once, Autopilot creates a staged plan where each experiment builds on the previous winner. Each stage focuses on one change — a new price point, a trial configuration, or a design update — so you can see what actually moves your metrics.

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/growth-strategy.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

### Hypotheses

Every recommendation comes with a clear hypothesis that explains the reasoning behind it. You'll see how your current metrics compare to competitors and industry averages. Each hypothesis highlights the opportunity Autopilot identified and which key metrics the test targets.

Once you've reviewed the report, head to [What's next](#whats-next) to start acting on the recommendations.

## What's next

Once your recommendations are ready, you can start acting on them.

Your plan consists of several stages that include setting new prices, updating paywalls, and running A/B tests. After each round, the winning strategy advances to the next round. The winner of the final round becomes your most efficient pricing option. Based on our estimates, completing the entire test cycle could increase your revenue by up to 80%.

To start with the first stage:

1. Create new products right from the report or modify your existing products. You can automatically push your new products to App Store and Google Play right away.
2. Duplicate your current top-performing paywall and add products to it. You can also modify your paywall design according to the recommendations or generate a new one using the AI generator in the [Adapty Paywall Builder](adapty-paywall-builder.md).
3. Launch an A/B test to compare how the new paywall performs against the current paywall.

:::important
The recommendations page shows you the target number of subscribers and the minimum duration for the A/B test. Follow these recommendations to get the most accurate data before you begin with the next stage. You will need to stop the A/B test manually.
