Your account page can be accessed through the link in the top right corner after you've logged into Adapty. Or just by [this link](https://app.adapty.io/account).

There are several important things you can set on your account page, so let's go through them. 

<Zoom>
  <img src="/assets/shared/img/27b3508-CleanShot_2022-12-21_at_20.47.10.webp"
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

## General settings

Here you fill in your name and the name of your company. It's useful to have this information when you contact support, so they can work with your correctly filled profile.

  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

Your main credentials are also on this part of the page.  
So you may change your password here or check what email your account is registered for. 

## Date and time format

As part of general settings, the date and time format deserves to be highlighted separately because it can make your life with Adapty easier.  
By selecting the option, you can choose between American or European format to display dates and times in your preferred way.  
For example, if you prefer January 31, 2022 date format and it's common for you to use AM and PM in time, your choice is the American format.  
And vice versa, if it's common for you to use 31 January, 2022 date format and see the time as 16:00, then your option is European format.
