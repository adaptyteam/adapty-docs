In Adapty, you can edit your product's name, access level, and connected store IDs. Price and subscription duration are not editable after you create the product, so you need to create a new product in order to change them.

:::warning
While you can edit any product, it's crucial to ensure that making changes to products already used in live paywalls doesn't lead to discrepancies in your analytics.

**Editing access level, App Store Product ID, and Play Store Product ID is not recommended** because it may affect analytics clarity. Only edit them if you made a mistake, like a typo in the product ID.

If you no longer use the product and want to replace it with another one, we strongly advise you to create a new product and update Paywalls and A/B tests accordingly.
:::

To edit the product:

1. Go to **[Products](https://app.adapty.io/products)** from the Adapty main menu.
2. Click the **3-dot** button next to the product and select **Edit**.
3. In the opened **Edit** window, make the changes you need. For more details on the options in this window, please read the [Create product](create-product) section.
4. Click **Save**.

If you edit or delete a product in App Store Connect or Google Play Console, the changes won't automatically sync to Adapty. To keep data consistent, make the same changes in both places or create a new product.

:::note
If you change the access level, the change applies only to new subscriptions. For existing subscribers, the current access level remains unchanged and updates automatically upon the next subscription renewal.
