If you've already implemented the Adapty SDK in your Android app, you'll want to test that everything is set up correctly and that purchases work as expected. This involves testing both the SDK integration and the actual purchase flow with Google Play's sandbox environment.

## Test your app

For comprehensive testing of your in-app purchases, including sandbox testing and closed track validation, see our [testing guide](testing-on-android.md).

## Prepare for release

Before submitting your app to the store, follow the [Release checklist](release-checklist) to confirm:

- Store connection and server notifications are configured
- Purchases complete and are reported to Adapty
- Access unlocks and restores correctly
- Privacy and review requirements are met
