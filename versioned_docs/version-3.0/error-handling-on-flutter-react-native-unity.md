Every error is returned by the SDK is `AdaptyErrorCode`. Here is an example:

<Tabs groupId="current-os" queryString>
<TabItem value="flutter" label="Flutter" default>
```javascript showLineNumbers
    try {
      final result = await adapty.makePurchase(product: product);
    } on AdaptyError catch (adaptyError) {
      if (adaptyError.code == AdaptyErrorCode.paymentCancelled) {
        // Cancelled
      }
    } catch (e) {
    }
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="unity" label="Unity" default>
```csharp showLineNumbers
Adapty.MakePurchase(product, (profile, error) => {
  if (error != null && error.Code == Adapty.ErrorCode.PaymentCancelled) {
      // payment cancelled
  }
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rn" label="React Native (TS)" default>
```typescript showLineNumbers
try {
  const params: MakePurchaseParamsInput = {};
  await adapty.makePurchase(product, params);
} catch (error) {
  if (
    error instanceof AdaptyError &&
    error.adaptyCode === getErrorCode(ErrorCode['2'])
  ) {
    // payment cancelled
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
