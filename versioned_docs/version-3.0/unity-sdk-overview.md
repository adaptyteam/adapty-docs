import Zoom from 'react-medium-image-zoom';
import 'react-medium-image-zoom/dist/styles.css';

First, we need to describe:
- What is Adapty SDK and why do they need it
- What are the main concepts
- Probably redirect those who haven't set up the dashboard part to the UI quickstart

### Get started

Describe the main steps (1-2-3-4 in the **Get started section**) and provide links to them, like:

1. [Install & configure SDK](sdk-installation-unity.md): something about installation and activation
2. [Identify users](unity-quickstart-identify.md): something short about working with users in your app
3. [Present a paywall](unity-quickstart-paywalls.md): something short about getting and showing paywalls
4. [Check the subscription status](unity-check-subscription-status.md): something about checking the subscription status to understand whether the user can access paid content


As a tip, maybe we can prompt them to use LLMs for implementation and provide a link to the Use with Cursor page 

Also, something about migration here in the form of a note
