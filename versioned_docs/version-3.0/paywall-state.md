Paywalls can have four distinct states:

- **Draft**: These paywalls are in the preparation stage and have never been used in any placements or A/B tests. Use this state while you are designing your paywall until you are ready to use it in your mobile app.
- **Live**: These paywalls are currently active and running in placements and/or A/B tests. Live paywalls can be used in multiple A/B tests and associated with various placements. You may conduct one or more A/B tests based on a live paywall if it turns out to be effective.
- **Inactive**: These paywalls were previously active in placements but are no longer live. You can repurpose an inactive paywall for a new A/B test or choose to [archive it](archive-paywalls) if it is no longer required.
- **Archived**: These paywalls are no longer in use and have been archived. You can always [restore the archived paywall to an active state](restore-paywall).
