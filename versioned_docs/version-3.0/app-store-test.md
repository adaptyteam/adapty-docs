Once you've configured everything in the Adapty Dashboard and your mobile app, it's time to conduct in-app purchase testing.

There are two ways to test purchases in your iOS app:

- [**Sandbox testing**](test-purchases-in-sandbox.md): Use a sandbox account and run your app from Xcode or download it from TestFlight. This option allows you to test the whole purchase flow and see the profile updates in the Adapty dashboard.
- [**StoreKit testing in Xcode**](local-sk-files.md): Run your app from Xcode without having to create or reset a sandbox account. This option works best for developers who can test different scenarios in the Xcode environment. However, note that all the scenarios are executed locally, and you won't see any changes in the Adapty dashboard.
