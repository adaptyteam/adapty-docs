A [Placement](placements) designates a specific location within your mobile app where a paywall, onboarding, or A/B test can be displayed. For example, a subscription choice might appear in a startup flow, while a consumable product (such as golden coins) could be presented when a user runs out of coins in a game. 

You have the flexibility to showcase the same or different paywalls, onboardings, or A/B tests across multiple placements or user segments, called audiences in Adapty.

To edit an existing placement:

1. Go to **[Placements](https://app.adapty.io/placements)** from the Adapty main menu. If you want to edit a placement for onboarding, switch to the **Onboardings** tab.
2. Click the placement you want to edit. 
3. Click **Edit placement** at the top right.
4. Make the changes you need. For more details on the options in this window, please read the [Create placement](create-placement) section.
5. Click the **Save and publish** button to confirm the changes.
