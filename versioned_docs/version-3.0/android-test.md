If you've already implemented the Adapty SDK in your Android app, you'll want to test that everything is set up correctly and that purchases work as expected. This involves testing both the SDK integration and the actual purchase flow with Google Play's sandbox environment.

For comprehensive testing of your in-app purchases, including sandbox testing and closed track validation, see our [testing guide](testing-on-android.md).
