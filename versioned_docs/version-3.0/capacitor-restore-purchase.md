Restoring Purchases in both iOS and Android is a feature that allows users to regain access to previously purchased content, such as subscriptions or in-app purchases, without being charged again. This feature is especially useful for users who may have uninstalled and reinstalled the app or switched to a new device and want to access their previously purchased content without paying again.

:::note
In paywalls built with [Paywall Builder](adapty-paywall-builder), purchases are restored automatically without additional code from you. If that's your case â€” you can skip this step.
:::

To restore a purchase if you do not use the [Paywall Builder](adapty-paywall-builder) to customize the paywall, call `.restorePurchases()` method:

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { adapty } from '@adapty/capacitor';

try {
  const profile = await adapty.restorePurchases();
  const isSubscribed = profile.accessLevels['YOUR_ACCESS_LEVEL']?.isActive;
  
  if (isSubscribed) {
    // Restore access to paid features
    console.log('Access restored successfully!');
  } else {
    console.log('No active subscriptions found');
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to restore purchases:', error);
}
```
