[Analytics](https://app.adapty.io/ua/analytics) is a section of the Adapty UA Dashboard that allows you to see multiple campaign metrics in a single place. You can customize which charts you would like to see and view data for all of your campaigns at once.

## Metrics

Adapty User Acquisition provides comprehensive **metrics** to measure campaign performance and user behavior. These metrics are available as standard values, with key metrics also offered as **cohort metrics** for time-based analysis of user groups.

See the complete metric list [here](ua-metrics.md).

## Customize which metrics to show

You can customize which metrics to show as well as their order. To do that, click the current present name (it's **Default** at first) in the top-right corner, select **Edit columns** and then either remove charts you don't need, add more or rearrange existing ones by drag and dropping.

For cohort metrics, you can add one or more cohorts at once. Select them from the existing cohorts or create custom ones.

You can also save views you use most as presets, so you can switch between them quickly anytime. Click the current preset name and click the **Save** icon or, in the **Edit columns** window, click **Save as preset**.

## Controls

On the **Analytics** page, you have four main controls:
- **Time ranges**: See [more](controls-filters-grouping-compare-proceeds#time-ranges).
- **Filters**: Filter by metrics, so you can see only those values that are above or below some threshold.
- **Group by**: Group by campaign parameters (like campaign ID or country) or time periods, so the results are better organized.
- **Store commission and taxes**: See [more](controls-filters-grouping-compare-proceeds#store-commission-and-taxes).
