[Analytics](https://app.adapty.io/ua/analytics) is a section of the Adapty UA Dashboard that allows you to see multiple campaign metrics in a single place. You can customize which charts you would like to see and view data for all of your campaigns at once.



## Metrics

The **Analytics** page has the following campaign metrics available:

## Cohorts metrics



## Customize which metrics to show

You can customize which metrics to show as well as their order. To do that, press Edit in the top-right corner and then either remove charts you don't need, add more or rearrange existing ones by drag and dropping. You can also customize Overview contents in the "Add" menu:

## Controls

Controls for diving deeper into your data in Overview are very similar to what we have in [Charts](charts) — and most of them are described in [Analytics controls](controls-filters-grouping-compare-proceeds).

There is one important difference, though: you can group and filter by country, store, and, most notably, by app — as Overview shows data for all of your apps at once by default. This can be helpful to understand how each of your app contributes to your business metrics:



:::note
**Timezone and install settings**

Note that these settings apply to all your apps and override what you have in [App settings](general).

- **Installs**: By default, installs are counted by `device_id`—a new installation or reinstallation on a device is counted as a separate install. You can change it by clicking **Edit**. For a detailed explanation of other options, see the [Installs definition for analytics](general#4-installs-definition-for-analytics) section.
- **Timezone**: By default, the timezone for the **Overview** page is inherited from one of your apps. If your apps have different reporting timezones, customize the Overview timezone by clicking **Edit** and selecting the appropriate option from the dropdown.
