If you've customized a paywall using the Paywall Builder, you don't need to worry about rendering it in your mobile app code to display it to the user. Such a paywall contains both what should be shown within the paywall and how it should be shown.

:::warning

This guide is for **legacy Paywall Builder paywalls** only which require SDK v2.x or earlier. The process for presenting paywalls differs for paywalls designed with different versions of Paywall Builder and remote config paywalls.

- For fetching **New Paywall Builder paywalls**, check out [Present new Paywall Builder paywalls](present-pb-paywalls).
