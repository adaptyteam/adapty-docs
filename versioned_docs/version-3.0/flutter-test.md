If you've already implemented the Adapty SDK in your Flutter app, you'll want to test that everything is set up correctly and that purchases work as expected across both iOS and Android platforms. This involves testing both the SDK integration and the actual purchase flow with Apple's sandbox environment and Google Play's testing environment.

For comprehensive testing of your in-app purchases, see our platform-specific testing guides: [iOS testing guide](testing-purchases-ios.md) and [Android testing guide](testing-on-android.md).
