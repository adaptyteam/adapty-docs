If you already have your own purchase infrastructure and aren't ready to fully switch to Adapty, you can explore [Observer mode](observer-vs-full-mode). In its basic form, Observer Mode offers advanced analytics and seamless integration with attribution and analytics systems.

If this meets your needs, you only need to:
1. Turn it on when configuring the Adapty SDK by setting the `observerMode` parameter to `true`.
2. [Report transactions](report-transactions-observer-mode) from your existing purchase infrastructure to Adapty.

If you also need paywalls and A/B testing, additional setup is required, as described below.

## Observer mode setup

Turn on the Observer mode if you handle purchases and subscription status yourself and use Adapty for sending subscription events and analytics.

:::important
When running in Observer mode, Adapty SDK won't close any transactions, so make sure you're handling it.

## Using Adapty paywalls in Observer Mode

If you also want to use Adapty's paywalls and A/B testing features, you can â€” but it requires some extra setup in Observer mode. Here's what you'll need to do in addition to the steps above:

1. Display paywalls as usual for [remote config paywalls](present-remote-config-paywalls). For Paywall Builder paywalls, follow the specific setup guides for [iOS](ios-present-paywall-builder-paywalls-in-observer-mode).
3. [Associate paywalls](report-transactions-observer-mode) with purchase transactions.
