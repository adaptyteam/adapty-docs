Adapty's Server-Side API v2 introduces new capabilities and improvements to help you manage access levels, transactions, and user profiles more effectively.

## Why Migrate?

The second version of the Server-Side API gives you more flexibility and features when working with Adapty:

- **Separate access level management**: Assign access levels to users without requiring transaction details, making it easier to handle compensations, bonuses, or other non-transactional scenarios.
- **Record one-time purchases**: Log transactions for consumable product purchases by providing consumable-product-specific fields.
- **Enhanced transaction details:** Include more data with transactions, like refunds, billing issues, cancellation reasons, renewals, and more.
- **Profile updates:** Instead of just adding attributes, you can update a user’s profile. For instance, you can add installation metadata or disable external analytics if needed.

Although v1 is still supported, we recommend moving to v2 for expanded functionality and ongoing updates.

## Changes Overview

| Change                              | Required action                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Base URL and Endpoint**           | Base URL and all endpoints are changed. Update your configuration as described in the request endpoints |
| **Request Headers**                 | <ol><li> Add either `adapty-profile-id` or `adapty-customer-user-id` as a header.</li><li> Add a new `adapty-platform` header.</li></ol> |
| **Request and Response Structure**  | Modify parameters as outlined for each request and update your integration to handle the [new response formats](api-responses). |
| **Changed access level management** | The old [Prolong/grant a subscription for a user](server-side-api-specs-legacy#prolonggrant-a-subscription-for-a-user) request is now split into three: <ul><li> [Set Transaction](ss-set-transaction): Add transaction details with adding access.</li><li> [Grant Access Level](ss-grant-access-level): Add or extend access without transaction.</li><li> [Revoke Access Level](ss-revoke-access-level): Shorten or revoke access without transaction.</li></ul> |

## Migration Steps

:::note

To simplify using our server-side API, we've prepared a Postman collection and an environment file you can download and import into Postman.

[Download the collection and environment](Adapty_server_side_API_postman_collection.zip)

:::

<!---


1. **Base URL and Endpoint**: Please pay attention to the request endpoints and update all of them with new ones.
2. **Request Header**: In v2, requests require either `adapty-profile-id` or `adapty-customer-user-id` as the header. In addition, a new `adapty-platform` header should be added to the request.
3. **New Access Management Requests:** The old [Prolong/grant a subscription for a user](server-side-api-specs-legacy#prolonggrant-a-subscription-for-a-user) request is now split into three:
   - [Set Transaction](ss-set-transaction): Add transaction details with adding access.
   - [Grant Access Level](ss-grant-access-level): Add or extend access without transaction.
   - [Revoke Access Level](ss-revoke-access-level): Shorten or revoke access without transaction.
4. **Request and Response Structure:** Modify parameters as outlined for each request and update your integration to handle the [new response formats](api-responses).

--->

### Step 1. Configure request headers

Add new request headers as follows:

| **Header**                  | **Description**                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **adapty-profile-id**       | (Required, choose one) The user’s Adapty profile ID. Visible in the **Adapty ID** field in the [Adapty Dashboard -> **Profiles**](https://app.adapty.io/profiles/users) -> specific profile page. Interchangeable with **adapty-customer-user-id**, use any of them. |
| **adapty-customer-user-id** |<p>(Required, choose one) The user’s ID in your system. Visible in the **Customer user ID** field in the [Adapty Dashboard -> **Profiles**](https://app.adapty.io/profiles/users) -> specific profile page. Interchangeable with **adapty-profile-id**, use any of them.</p><p>⚠️ Works only if you [identify users](http://localhost:3000/docs/identifying-users) in your app code using the Adapty SDK.</p>|
| **adapty-platform**         | Specify the app's platform. Possible options: `iOS`, `macOS`, `iPadOS`, `visionOS`, `Android`. |

---

### Step 2. Change transaction and access management requests

In version 1, you used to use:

- [Prolong/Grant a Subscription for a User](server-side-api-specs-legacy#prolonggrant-a-subscription-for-a-user) request:  to record a transaction and grant or shorten access level.
- [Revoke access level](server-side-api-specs-legacy#revoke-subscription-from-a-user) request: to immediately revoke access.

They are now replaced with three separate requests to distinguish between adding transactions and managing access levels:

1. **[Grant Access Level](ss-grant-access-level):** Use this request to extend an access level without linking it to a transaction.
2. **[Revoke Access Level](ss-revoke-access-level):** to immediately revoke or shorten access.
3. **[Set Transaction](ss-set-transaction):** Use this request to add transaction details to Adapty with access levels.

---

#### Step 2.1. How to grant access level

:::info

For a detailed description, refer to the [Grant access level](ss-grant-access-level) request.

:::

In version 1, the [Prolong/grant a subscription for a user](server-side-api-specs-legacy#prolonggrant-a-subscription-for-a-user) request was used to grant access. Now you can grant access with the [Grant access level](ss-grant-access-level) request without providing transaction details.

- **Endpoint:** `https://api.adapty.io/api/v2/server-side-api/grant/access-level/`
- Parameters to keep:
  - **access_level_id**: Previously in the endpoint. Required.
  - **starts_at**: Now nullable.
  - **expires_at**: Optional for lifetime access and nullable.

| Change     | Old value                                                    | How to change                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Endpoint   | `https://api.adapty.io/api/v1/sdk/profiles/{profile_id_or_customer_user_id}/paid-access-levels/{access_level}/grant/` | `https://api.adapty.io/api/v2/server-side-api/grant/access-level/` |
| Parameters | Many transaction parameters that are no longer needed in this request. | Parameters to keep: <ul><li> **access_level_id**: Previously in the endpoint. Required.</li><li> **starts_at**: Now nullable.</li><li> **expires_at**: Optional for lifetime access and nullable.</li></ul> |

--->

---

#### Step 2.2. How to revoke or shorten access level

:::info

For a detailed description, refer to the [Revoke access level](ss-revoke-access-level) request.

:::

In version 1, you used the [Revoke access level](server-side-api-specs-legacy#revoke-subscription-from-a-user) request to immediately revoke access and the [Prolong/Grant a Subscription for a User](server-side-api-specs-legacy#prolonggrant-a-subscription-for-a-user) request to shorten it. Now you can use the [Revoke access level](ss-revoke-access-level) request for both actions.

<!---

| Change     | Old value                                                    | How to change                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Endpoint   | `https://api.adapty.io/api/v1/sdk/profiles/{profile_id_or_customer_user_id}/paid-access-levels/{access_level}/grant/` | `https://api.adapty.io/api/v2/server-side-api/grant/access-level/` |
| Parameters | Many transaction parameters that are no longer needed in this request. | Parameters to keep: <ul><li> **access_level_id**: Previously in the endpoint. Required.</li><li> **starts_at**: Now nullable.</li><li> **expires_at**: Optional for lifetime access and nullable.</li></ul> |

--->

- **Endpoint:** `https://api.adapty.io/api/v2/server-side-api/purchase/profile/revoke/access-level/`
- Parameters to keep:
  - **access_level_id**: Required.
  - **expires_at**: Nullable unless access is revoked immediately.

#### Step 2.3. How to record a subscription transaction

:::info

For a detailed description, refer to the [Set transaction](ss-set-transaction) request.

:::

In version 1, transactions were recorded using the [Prolong/Grant a Subscription for a User](server-side-api-specs-legacy#prolonggrant-a-subscription-for-a-user) request, which was limited to subscription transactions.

In version 2, this functionality has been replaced by the [Set Transaction](ss-set-transaction) request. This request can handle both subscription transactions and one-time purchases.

- **Endpoint:** `https://api.adapty.io/api/v2/server-side-api/purchase/set/transaction/`

### Step 3. Change `Get info about a user` request

:::info

For a detailed description, refer to the [Get profile](ss-get-profile) request.

:::

Change the request as follows:

- **Endpoint:** `https://api.adapty.io/api/v2/server-side-api/profile/`
- **Change:** The User Profile ID or Customer User ID is now passed via headers, and no additional parameters are needed. The **extended** parameter is no longer needed as the complete profile data is always returned.

---

### Step 4. Change `Set the user's attribute` request

:::info

For a detailed description, refer to the [Update profile](ss-update-profile) request.

:::
