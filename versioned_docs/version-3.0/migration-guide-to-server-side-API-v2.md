Adapty's Server-Side API v2 introduces new capabilities and improvements to help you manage access levels, transactions, and user profiles more effectively.

## Why Migrate?

The second version of the Server-Side API gives you more flexibility and features when working with Adapty:

- **Separate access level management and transaction recording**:
  - **Grant access without transactions**: Assign access levels to users without requiring transaction details, making it easier to handle compensations, bonuses, or other non-transactional scenarios.
  - **Record one-time purchases without granting access**: Log transactions for consumable product purchases without affecting the user's access level.
- **Enhanced transaction details:** Include more data with transactions, like refunds, billing issues, cancellation reasons, renewals, and more.
- **Profile updates:** Instead of just adding attributes, you can update a user’s profile. For instance, you can add installation metadata or disable external analytics if needed.

Although v1 is still supported, we recommend moving to v2 for expanded functionality and ongoing updates.

## Migration Steps

### General Changes

1. **Base URL Update:**
   - Change from `https://api.adapty.io/api/v1/sdk/` to `https://api-admin.adapty.io/api/v1/server-side-api/`.
2. **Endpoint Changes:** Refer to the updated endpoints for each specific request.
3. **Authorization Updates:**
   - Move `{profile_id_or_customer_user_id}` from the endpoint to a header.
   - Remove `{access_level}` from the endpoint and include it as a parameter where needed.
   - Add a new `adapty-platform` header with options like `iOS`, `macOS`, `iPadOS`, `visionOS`, or `Android`.
4. **Unified Access Revocation:** In v1, you used separate requests to revoke or shorten access. Now, use the [Revoke access level](server-side-api-specs#revoke-access-level) request for both.
5. **New Access Management Requests:**The old [Prolong/grant a subscription for a user](server-side-api-specs-legacy#prolonggrant-a-subscription-for-a-user) request is now split into three:
   - [Grant Access Level](server-side-api-specs#grant-access-level): Add or extend access without transaction info.
   - [Revoke Access Level](server-side-api-specs#revoke-access-level): Shorten or revoke access.
   - [Set Transaction](server-side-api-specs#set-transaction): Add transaction details without adding access.
6. **Parameter Updates:** Modify parameters as outlined for each request.
7. **Response Handling:** Update your integration to handle the [new response formats](api-responses).

### Prolong/grant a subscription for a user

1. This request is now replaced with three separate requests to distinguish between adding transactions and managing access levels:
   1. **Grant Access Level:** Use this request to extend an access level without linking it to a transaction.
   2. Revoke Access Level:
      - In version 1, you used the [Revoke access level](server-side-api-specs-legacy#revoke-subscription-from-a-user) request to immediately revoke access and the [Prolong/Grant a Subscription for a User](server-side-api-specs-legacy#prolonggrant-a-subscription-for-a-user) request to shorten it.
      - In version 2, both actions are handled by the [Revoke access level](server-side-api-specs#revoke-access-level) request.
   3. **Set Transaction:** Use this request to add transaction details to Adapty without managing access levels.

#### Grant Access Level

:::info

For a detailed description, refer to the [Grant access level](server-side-api-specs#grant-access-level) request.

:::

Grant or extend access for a user without tying it to a transaction.

- **Endpoint:** `https://api-admin.adapty.io/api/v1/server-side-api/grant/access-level/`
- Parameters to keep:
  - **access_level_id**: Previously in the endpoint. Required.
  - **starts_at**: Now nullable.
  - **expires_at**: Optional for lifetime access and nullable.

#### Revoke access level

:::info

For a detailed description, refer to the [Revoke access level](server-side-api-specs#revoke-access-level) request.

:::

Revoke or shorten a user’s access.

- **Endpoint:** `https://api-admin.adapty.io/api/v1/server-side-api/purchase/profile/revoke/access-level/`
- Parameters to keep:
  - **access_level_id**: Required.
  - **expires_at**: Nullable unless access is revoked immediately.

#### Set transaction

:::info

For a detailed description, refer to the [Set transaction](server-side-api-specs#set-transaction) request.

:::

Submit a transaction to Adapty, separate from granting or revoking access.

- **Endpoint:** `https://api-admin.adapty.io/api/v1/server-side-api/purchase/set/transaction/`
- **Details:** Parameters depend on whether the purchase is a subscription or one-time product. See specific guidelines for each.

### Revoke subscription from a user

:::info

For a detailed description, refer to the [Revoke access level](server-side-api-specs#revoke-access-level) request.

:::

In version 1, you used the [Revoke subscription from a user](server-side-api-specs-legacy#revoke-subscription-from-a-user) request to immediately remove access. Now, use the [Revoke access level](server-side-api-specs#revoke-access-level) request to either immediately remove access or shorten it.

- **Endpoint:** `https://api-admin.adapty.io/api/v1/server-side-api/purchase/profile/revoke/access-level/`
- **New Option:** Specify a future revoke date (`revoke_at`) if immediate revocation isn’t needed.
