import Zoom from 'react-medium-image-zoom';

Event feed allows you to visually track [Events](events) generated by Adapty and check the status of their export to 3rd-party integrations, including the webhook. Please note that [transactions generated with server-side API](ss-set-transaction) do not appear in the **Event Feed**.

<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/event-status.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

:::note
AppsFlyer, Facebook Ads, and Branch sending status could be inaccurate because they do not always return errors when they occur.
