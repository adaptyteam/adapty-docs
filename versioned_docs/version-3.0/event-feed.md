Event feed allows you to visually track [Events](events) generated by Adapty and check the status of their export to 3rd-party integrations, including the webhook. 

:::warning

Keep in mind that transactions created using the [server-side API (version 1)](server-side-api-specs-legacy#requests) do not appear in the **Event Feed**. To ensure they are included, use the [server-side API (version 2)](ss-set-transaction) instead.

<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/event-status.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

:::note
AppsFlyer, Facebook Ads, and Branch sending status could be inaccurate because they do not always return errors when they occur.

To view the profile of the user who has initiated the transaction, click the **View Profile** button in the event details.
