Explain that the easiest way to start accepting payments in your app is:

1. Create a paywall in the builder: Explain that it allows you to automate handling purchases + rendering.
2. Create a placement and add the paywall to it: Explain that placements are rules telling which paywalls must be shown to audiences. You can create a placement with the same paywall for all users or add more paywalls.

Accompany all your instructions with links to more detailed explanations and advanced configuration options.

## 1. Build a paywall

Create a basic paywall in the builder:
1. Add a product (use the example from the previous article) and give your paywall a name.
2. Design a paywall â€“ use a template(?). Show how to add a product, its price, a purchase button and a close button.

:::note
Add a small note with links to articles where we describe paywalls built manually.

## 2. Add a paywall to a placement
