If you already have your own purchase infrastructure and aren't ready to fully switch to Adapty, you can explore [Observer mode](observer-vs-full-mode). In its basic form, Observer Mode offers advanced analytics and seamless integration with attribution and analytics systems.

If this meets your needs, you only need to:
1. Turn it on when configuring the Adapty SDK by setting the `observerMode` parameter to `true`. Follow the setup instructions for [React Native](sdk-installation-reactnative#configure-adapty-sdk).
2. [Report transactions](report-transactions-observer-mode-react-native) from your existing purchase infrastructure to Adapty.

If you also need paywalls and A/B testing, additional setup is required, as described below.

## Using Adapty paywalls in Observer Mode

If you also want to use Adapty's paywalls and A/B testing features, you can â€” but it requires some extra setup in Observer mode. Here's what you'll need to do in addition to the steps above:

1. Display paywalls as usual for [remote config paywalls](present-remote-config-paywalls-react-native.md).
3. [Associate paywalls](report-transactions-observer-mode-react-native) with purchase transactions.
