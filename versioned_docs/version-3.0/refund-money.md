The refund money chart displays the amount of money that was refunded for the selected period of time. Adapty attributes refund money to the moment when the refund was issued and the revenue decreases in the period when the refund occurred.

### Calculation

Adapty calculates the refund money chart considering only transactions that generate revenue, such as new paid subscriptions, renewals, and one-time purchases. Free trials, which do not generate revenue and cannot be refunded, are excluded from the transaction count. The refund amount is attributed to the date when the refund was made (not to when the subscription started), and the revenue decrease caused by the refunded subscription is reflected in the period in which the refund was processed.

It's important to note that Adapty calculates the refund amount before the store's fee is deducted.
