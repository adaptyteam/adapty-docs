The Refund money chart shows the amount refunded during the selected period. Adapty ties each refund event to the date it was issued, so revenue decreases in that same period.

### Calculation

Adapty counts only revenue-generating transactions—new paid subscriptions, renewals, and one-time purchases. Free trials, which produce no revenue and cannot be refunded, are excluded. Each refund amount is tied to the date it was processed, so the revenue decrease appears in that same period.

:::info
The refund amount is calculated before the store's fee is deducted.
