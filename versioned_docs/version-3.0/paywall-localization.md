In a world with many cultures, it's important to adapt your product for each country. You can do this by using paywall localizations. For each paywall, you can make versions in different languages to match the needs of specific local markets.

 Depending on what you use to design your paywalls, adding locale varies:

1. [Adding paywall locale in Adapty Paywall Builder](add-paywall-locale-in-adapty-paywall-builder)
2. [Adding paywall locale in remote config](add-remote-config-locale)

Once you add locales to a paywall, learn how to [correctly work with locale codes in your app's code](localizations-and-locale-codes).
