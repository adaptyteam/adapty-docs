In a world with many cultures, it's important to adapt your product for each country. You can do this by using paywall localizations. For each paywall, you can make versions in different languages to match the needs of specific local markets.

Depending on what you use to design your paywalls, adding locale varies:

1. [Adding paywall locale in Adapty Paywall Builder](add-paywall-locale-in-adapty-paywall-builder): If you create paywalls in the Adapty paywall builder, you localize all the paywall elements including text and media right in the builder. When you get a paywall in the app code, you control what you get by sending a locale.
2. [Adding paywall locale in remote config](add-remote-config-locale): If you don't use the paywall builder, Adapty can help you to control localizations without redeploying the app.

In both cases, you can [use AI to translate texts](add-remote-config-locale#translating-paywalls-with-ai).

Once you add locales to a paywall, learn how to [correctly work with locale codes in your app's code](localizations-and-locale-codes).
