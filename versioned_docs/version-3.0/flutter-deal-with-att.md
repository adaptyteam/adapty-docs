If your application uses AppTrackingTransparency framework and presents an app-tracking authorization request to the user, then you should send the [authorization status](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency/attrackingmanager/authorizationstatus/) to Adapty.

```dart showLineNumbers
final builder = AdaptyProfileParametersBuilder()
  ..setAppTrackingTransparencyStatus(AdaptyIOSAppTrackingTransparencyStatus.authorized);

try {
  await Adapty().updateProfile(builder.build());
} on AdaptyError catch (adaptyError) {
  // handle the error
} catch (e) {
  // handle unknown error
}
```

:::warning
We strongly recommend that you send this value as early as possible when it changes, only in that case the data will be sent in a timely manner to the integrations you have configured.
