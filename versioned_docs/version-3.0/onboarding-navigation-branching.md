Navigation and branching let you guide users through every step of your onboarding: use static routes to send everyone to core screens, and dynamic navigation to adapt the flow based on real-time user choices. All without writing a single line of code. 

## Set up navigation

You can configure static and dynamic navigation using buttons and quizzes. In case of quizzes, only single answer options can perform as a button to route users to the selected screen.

### Static navigation

Static navigation directs users to the same target screen.

### Dynamic navigation

Dynamic navigation routes users based on their previous quiz answers.
