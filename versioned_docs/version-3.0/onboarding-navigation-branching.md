Navigation and branching lets you guide users through every step of your onboarding: use static routes to send everyone to core screens, and dynamic navigation to adapt the flow based on user choices. All without writing a single line of code. 

## Set up navigation

You can configure static and dynamic navigation using [buttons](onboarding-buttons.md) and [quizzes](onboarding-quizzes.md). For quizzes, only single-answer quizzes are suitable for navigation.

### Static navigation

Static navigation directs users to the same target screen. To set it up:
1. Add a button or a single-answer quiz.
2. Select the button or quiz and go to the **Element** tab on the right.
3. Set up the **On Press** button section or **Behaviour** for the quiz:
- **Action on** (for quiz only): Select **Option** to unlock navigation settings for the quiz.
- **Action**: Select **Navigate**.
- **Data**: Select **Static** to direct users to the same target screen.
- **Destination**: Choose the destination screen.

:::note
With static navigation, a quiz directs users to the same screen regardless of the answer they select.

    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

### Dynamic navigation

Dynamic navigation routes users based on their previous quiz answers. To set it up:
1. Add a button or a single-answer quiz that will navigate users.
2. Select the button or quiz and go to the **Element** tab on the right.
3. Set up the **On Press** button section or **Behaviour** for the quiz:
- **Action on** (for quiz only): Select **Option** to unlock navigation settings for the quiz.
- **Action**: Select **Navigate**.
- **Data**: Select **Dynamic** to direct users based on their previous quiz answers.
- **State**: Choose a quiz whose answers determine the user destination.
4. Select the destination screen for each quiz option. 

Your button or quiz will then route users to the destinations you configured.

<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/dynamic-navigation.png').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

## Element visibility

You can also add conditional visibility to specific elements. Conditional elements are only visible to users who gave specific quiz answers.

For example, users who answered "What's your experience level" with "Beginner" will see extra details on the next step.

To make an element conditional:
1. Go to the **Element** tab on the right.
2. Select **Conditional** in the **Visible** section.
3. Set up the condition by choosing:
- quiz ID
- operator
- quiz answer
4. (Optional) Click **Advanced condition** to add multiple conditions.

For example, if you selected 'goal' as quiz ID, 'Has' as operator, and 'Education' as quiz answer, the element will be visible only to users whose answers for that quiz include the 'Education' option.

  }}
