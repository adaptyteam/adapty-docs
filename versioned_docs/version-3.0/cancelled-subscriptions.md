The Subscriptions renewal canceled chart displays the number of subscriptions that have had their auto-renew status switched off (canceled by the user). When a subscription's auto-renew status is turned off, it means that the subscription will not renew automatically for the next period. However, the user still retains access to the app's premium features until the end of the current period.
