Adapty's server-side API empowers you to programmatically access and manage your subscription data, enabling seamless integration with your existing services and infrastructure. Whether you're syncing data across platforms, granting access levels, or validating purchases in Stripe, this API provides the tools to keep your systems in sync and your users engaged.

## Postman collection and environment

To simplify using our web API, we've prepared a Postman collection and an environment file you can download and import into Postman.

- **Request Collection**: Includes all requests available in the Adapty web API. Note that it uses variables that you can define in the environment.
- **Environment**: Contains a list of variables where you can define values once. We've prepared a unified environment for the server-side API, web API, and analytics export API to make things easier for you. After making this environment active, Postman will automatically substitute the defined variable values in your requests.
