This is your first step toward growing in-app purchases. You can get started with Adapty in just four simple steps:

1. [**Add purchases**](quickstart-products.md): Add your inâ€‘app products or subscriptions to Adapty and link them to the App Store, Google Play, Stripe, Paddle, or a custom store.
2. [**Set up paywalls**](quickstart-paywalls.md): Create and design paywalls in Adapty, then show targeted storefronts to your users.
3. [**SDK integration**](quickstart-sdk.md): Integrate the Adapty SDK into your app, initialize it, and implement paywall fetching, user identification, and purchase handling.
4. [**Test**](quickstart-test.md): Verify your integration by checking SDK activation, fetching paywalls, and running test purchases.
