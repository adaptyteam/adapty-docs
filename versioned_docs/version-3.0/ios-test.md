If you've already implemented the Adapty SDK in your iOS app, you'll want to test that everything is set up correctly and that purchases work as expected. This involves testing both the SDK integration and the actual purchase.

For comprehensive testing of your in-app purchases, including sandbox testing and TestFlight validation, see our [testing guide](test-purchases-in-sandbox.md).
