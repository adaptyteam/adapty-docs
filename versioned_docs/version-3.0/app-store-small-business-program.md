## App Store Small Business Program

The App Store Small Business Program is a scheme that reduces the commission on App Store sales for eligible small businesses from 30% to 15%. The program is available to developers who earn less than $1 million in annual App Store revenue, subject to certain eligibility criteria. Further information about the program can be found on the App Store Small Business Program [page](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/).

Acknowledging your membership in the Small Business Program in your app settings is essential, as the reduced commission rate will impact the data sent for integrations and the information displayed in Adapty's charts. By providing this information through Adapty, you can simplify the enrollment process and take advantage of the reduced commission rate offered by the program.

To join the App Store Small Business Program, the first step is to visit the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/). Before applying, please make sure that you are the Account Holder in the Apple Developer Program, have accepted the latest Paid Applications contract in App Store Connect, and can list all associated developer accounts to the account for which you are applying.

After reviewing the program's terms, click the 'Enroll' button and sign in to your Apple Developer account. Apple's enrollment form will automatically fill in information like your name, email, and Team ID. After submitting your enrollment form, Apple will review your application. Once your enrollment is processed, you will receive a confirmation email that your enrollment is being reviewed.

## How Adapty calculates the proceeds App Store

Adapty can accurately calculate your app's earnings by deducting Apple's and Google's commissions and taking into account your eligibility for the Small Business Program.

In the Adapty Dashboard, the Small Business Program membership status is assigned to each individual app based on the developer's representation of multiple apps from different companies in their account. This means that the eligibility for the program is determined on a per-app basis.

You can add multiple periods by selecting a range of dates for each period in the same field. The date range represents the start and end date of the period during which your business was a member of the Small Business Program. Please note that the Entry Date refers to the earliest date in the range when your business became a member of the program, and the Exit Date refers to the latest date in the range when your business officially left or was removed from the program.

You can select your entry date according to your preference. However, it's important to note that if you select a past date, any webhooks and integration events already processed will not be resent with corrected pricing data. To ensure the accuracy of pricing data sent to your integrations, it's advisable to set your effective entry date as soon as possible. This way, you can receive reliable and up-to-date information on your transactions and make informed decisions accordingly.
