Paywalls configured with the [Paywall Builder](adapty-paywall-builder) don't need extra code to make and restore purchases. However, they generate some events that your app can respond to. Those events include button presses (close buttons, URLs, product selections, and so on) as well as notifications on purchase-related actions taken on the paywall. Learn how to respond to these events below.

:::warning
This guide is for **new Paywall Builder paywalls** only which require Adapty SDK v3.0 or later. For presenting paywalls in Adapty SDK v2 designed with legacy Paywall Builder, see [Handle paywall events designed with legacy Paywall Builder](react-native-handling-events-legacy).
:::

To control or monitor processes occurring on the paywall screen within your mobile app, implement the `view.registerEventHandlers` method:

```typescript showLineNumbers title="React Native (TSX)"
import {createPaywallView} from 'react-native-adapty/dist/ui';

const view = await createPaywallView(paywall);

const unsubscribe = view.registerEventHandlers({
  onCloseButtonPress() {
    return true;
  },
  onAndroidSystemBack() {
    return true;
  },
  onPurchaseCompleted(purchaseResult, product) {
    return purchaseResult.type !== 'user_cancelled';
  },
  onPurchaseStarted(product) { /***/},
  onPurchaseFailed(error) { /***/ },
  onRestoreCompleted(profile) { /***/ },
  onRestoreFailed(error, product) { /***/ },
  onProductSelected(productId) { /***/},
  onRenderingFailed(error) { /***/ },
  onLoadingProductsFailed(error) { /***/ },
  onUrlPress(url) { /* handle url */ },
});
```

You can register event handlers you need, and miss those you do not need. In this case, unused event listeners would not be created.

Note that at the very least you need to implement the reactions to both `onCloseButtonPress` and `onUrlPress`.

Event handlers return a boolean. If `true` is returned, the displaying process is considered complete, thus the paywall screen closes and event listeners for this view are removed. 

Note, that `onCloseButtonPress`, `onAndroidSystemBack`, and `onRestoreCompleted` in the example above return `true`, and the `onPurchaseCompleted` returns `purchaseResult.type !== 'user_cancelled'`. This is their default behavior that you can override. 

### Event handlers

| Event handler               | Description                                                  |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **onCustomAction**          | If a user performs some custom action, e.g. clicks a [custom button](paywall-buttons), this method will be invoked. |
| **onUrlPress**              | If a user clicks a URL in your paywall, this method will be invoked. |
| **onAndroidSystemBack**     | If a user taps the system Android **Back** button, this method will be invoked. |
| **onCloseButtonPress**      | If the close button is visible and a user taps it, this method will be invoked. It is recommended to dismiss the paywall screen in this handler. |
| **onPurchaseCompleted**     | If the purchase succeeds, the user cancels their purchase, or the purchase appears to be pending, this method will be invoked. In case of a successful purchase, it will provide an updated `AdaptyProfile`. |
| **onPurchaseStarted**       | If a user taps the "Purchase" action button to start the purchase process, this method will be invoked. |
| **onPurchaseCancelled**     | If a user initiates the purchase process and manually interrupts it, this method will be invoked. |
| **onPurchaseFailed**        | If the purchase process fails, this method will be invoked and provide `AdaptyError`. |
| **onRestoreStarted**        | If a user starts a purchase restoration, this method will be invoked. |
| **onRestoreCompleted**      | If a user's purchase restoration succeeds, this method will be invoked and provide an updated `AdaptyProfile`. It is recommended to dismiss the screen if the user has the required `accessLevel`. Refer to the [Subscription status](subscription-status) topic to learn how to check it. |
| **onRestoreFailed**         | If the restoring process fails, this method will be invoked and will provide `AdaptyError`. |
| **onProductSelected**       | When any product in the paywall view is selected, this method will be invoked, so that you can monitor what the user selects before the purchase. |
| **onRenderingFailed**       | If an error occurs during view rendering, this method will be invoked and provide `AdaptyError`. Such errors should not occur, so if you come across one, please let us know. |
| **onLoadingProductsFailed** | If you  haven't set `prefetchProducts: true` in view creation, AdaptyUI will retrieve the necessary objects from the server by itself. If this operation fails, this method will be invoked and provide `AdaptyError`. |
