### Calculation

The Grace Period Converted Revenue chart displays the daily revenue generated by subscription renewals of users in a grace period.

The Grace period begins when the subscription enters the billing issue state due to a payment failure and ends after a specified amount of time (6 days for weekly subscriptions, 16 days for all other subscriptions) or when payment is successfully received. The chart provides insights into the effectiveness of the grace period feature and can help identify potential issues with payment processing or subscription management.
