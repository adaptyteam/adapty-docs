Adapty's integration with Amazon S3 allows you to store event and paywall visit data securely in one central location. You will be able to save your [subscription events](events) to your Amazon S3 bucket as .csv files.  
To set up this integration, you will need to follow a few simple steps in the AWS Console and Adapty dashboard.

:::note
Schedule

Adapty sends your data every **24h** at 4:00 UTC.

Each file will contain data for the events created for the entire previous calendar day in UTC. For example, the data exported automatically at 4:00 UTC on March 8th will contain all the events created on March 7th from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 in UTC.
:::

## How to set up Amazon S3 integration

To start receiving data, you'll need the following credentials:

1. Access key ID
2. Secret access key
3. S3 bucket name
4. Folder name inside the S3 bucket

:::note
Nested directories

You can specify nested directories in the Amazon S3 bucket name field, e.g. adapty-events/com.sample-app
:::

To integrate Amazon S3 go to [**Integrations** -> **Amazon S3**](https://app.adapty.io/integrations/s3), turn on a toggle from off to on, and fill out fields.

First of all set credentials to build a connection between Amazon S3 and Adapty profiles.

</Zoom>

In the Adapty Dashboard, the following fields are needed to set up the connection:

| Field                        | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Key ID**            | A unique identifier that is used to authenticate a user or application's access to an AWS service.  Find this ID in the downloaded [csv file](s3-exports#how-to-create-amazon-s3-credentials) . |
| **Secret Access Key**        | A private key that is used in conjunction with the Access Key ID to authenticate a user or application's access to an AWS service. Find this Key in the downloaded  [csv file](s3-exports#how-to-create-amazon-s3-credentials) . |
| **S3 Bucket Name**           | A globally unique name that identifies a specific S3 bucket within the AWS cloud. S3 buckets are a simple storage service that allows users to store and retrieve data objects, such as files and images, in the cloud. |
| **Folder Inside the Bucker** | The  name of the folder that you want to have inside the selected S3 bucket. Please note that S3 simulates folders using object key prefixes, which are essentially folder names. |

## How to create Amazon S3 credentials

This guide will help you create the necessary credentials in your AWS Console.

### 1\. Create Access Policy

First, navigate to the [IAM Policy Dashboard](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/policies) in your AWS Console and select the option to **Create Policy**.


<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/7af075c-CleanShot_2023-03-21_at_10.52.002x.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





In the Policy editor, paste the following JSON and change `adapty-s3-integration-test` to your bucket name: 

```json showLineNumbers title="Json"
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowListObjectsInBucket",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::adapty-s3-integration-test"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowAllObjectActions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*Object",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::adapty-s3-integration-test/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::adapty-s3-integration-test"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowBucketLocation",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:GetBucketLocation",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::adapty-s3-integration-test"
        }
    ]
}
```


<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/d4e474a-CleanShot_2023-03-21_at_10.56.212x.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





After completing the policy configuration, you may choose to add tags (optional) and then click **Next** to proceed to the final step. In this step, you will name your policy and simply click on the **Create policy** button to finalize the creation process.


<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/7dcb02f-CleanShot_2023-03-21_at_11.03.372x.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





### 2\. Create IAM user

To enable Adapty to upload raw data reports to your bucket, you will need to provide them with the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for a user who has write access to the specific bucket. 

To proceed with that, navigate to the IAM Console and select the [Users section](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users). From there, click on the **Add users** button.


<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/bb612c8-CleanShot_2023-03-21_at_11.12.392x.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





Give the user a name, choose **Access key – Programmatic access**, and proceed to permissions.


<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/467ee4d-j6aoX.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





For the next step, please select the **Add user to group** option and then click the **Create group** button.


<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/bfd0e80-CleanShot_2023-03-21_at_11.24.592x.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





Next, you need to assign a name to your User Group and select the policy that was previously created by you. Once you have selected the policy, click on the **Create group** button to complete the process.


<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/df29c12-CleanShot_2023-03-21_at_11.28.052x.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





After successfully creating the group, please **select it** and proceed to the next step.


<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/1f3722e-CleanShot_2023-03-21_at_11.36.192x.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





Since this is the final step for this section, you may proceed by simply clicking on the **Create User** button.


<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/ea43722-CleanShot_2023-03-21_at_11.40.462x.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





Lastly, you can either **download the credentials in .csv** format or alternatively, copy and paste the credentials directly from the dashboard.

  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





## Manual data export

In addition to the automatic event data export to Amazon S3, Adapty also provides a manual file export functionality. With this feature, you can select a specific time interval for the event data and export it to your S3 bucket manually. This allows you to have greater control over the data you export and when you export it. 

The specified date range will be used to export the events created from Date A 00:00:00 UTC up to Date B 23:59:59 UTC.

## Table structure

In AWS S3 integration, Adapty provides a table to store historical data for transaction events and paywall visits. The table contains information about the user profile, revenue and proceeds, and the origin store, among other data points. Essentially, these tables log all transactions generated by an app for a given time period.

:::warning
Note that this structure may grow over time — with new data being introduced by us or by the 3rd parties we work with. Make sure that your code that processes it is robust enough and relies on the specific fields, but not on the structure as a whole.

## Events and tags

You can manage what data is communicated by the integration. The integration offers the following configuration options:

| Setting                            | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exclude Historical Events**      | Opt to exclude events that occurred before the user installed the app with Adapty SDK. This prevents duplication of events and ensures accurate reporting. For instance, if a user activated a monthly subscription on January 10th and updated the app with Adapty SDK on March 6th, Adapty will omit events before March 6th and retain subsequent events. |
| **Include events without profile** | Opt to include transactions that are not linked to a user profile in Adapty. These may include purchases made before Adapty SDK was installed or transactions received from store server notifications that cannot be immediately associated with a specific user. |
| **Send User Attributes**           | If you wish to send user-specific attributes, like language preferences, and your OneSignal plan supports more than 10 tags, select this option. Enabling this allows the inclusion of additional information beyond the default 10 tags. Note that exceeding tag limits may result in errors. |
