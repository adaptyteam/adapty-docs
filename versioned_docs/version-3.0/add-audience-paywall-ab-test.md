Audiences in Adapty are segments of your customers that let you target the paywalls or A/B tests accurately. You can set up these [segments](segments) using specific filters, making sure that the right paywalls show up for the right people.

When it comes to [placement](placements) in Adapty, adding an audience to it means you're aiming specific content — like paywalls or A/B tests — at certain user groups. Linking an audience with a placement ensures that the content you want is seen by the right users at the right points in their app journey.

Open the placement to which you want to add a paywall or an A/B test or create a new one from the [Placements](https://app.adapty.io/placements) section in the Adapty main menu.
