**Audiences** in Adapty are groups of users defined by [segments](segments). They let you show paywalls, onboardings, and A/B tests to the users who should see them. Build segments with filters to ensure each group gets the right content.

When you add an audience to a [placement](placements), you target paywalls, onboardings, or A/B tests at a specific user group. Linking an audience to a placement makes sure the right users see the right content at the right moment in their app journey.

Open the placement where you want to add a paywall, onboarding, or A/B test, or create a new one in the [Placements](https://app.adapty.io/placements) menu.
