**Audiences** in Adapty are groups of users based on [segments](segments), helping you customize paywalls, onboardings, or A/B tests for specific user groups. You can define these segments using filters to ensure the right users see the right paywall or onboarding in your app.

:::info
[Onboardings](https://adapty.io/docs/onboardings) are currently available only on the Enterprise plan.
:::

When it comes to [placement](placements) in Adapty, adding an audience to it means you're aiming specific content — like paywalls, onboardings, or A/B tests — at certain user groups. Linking an audience with a placement ensures that the content you want is seen by the right users at the right points in their app journey.

Open the placement to which you want to add a paywall, onboarding, or an A/B test or create a new one from the [Placements](https://app.adapty.io/placements) section in the Adapty main menu.
