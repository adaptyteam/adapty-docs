Migration has three steps:

1. Switching to Adapty SDK.
2. Changing [Apple](enable-app-store-server-notifications)/ [Google](enable-real-time-developer-notifications-rtdn) server2server notifications webhook.
3. (Optional) [Importing historical data to Adapty](importing-historical-data-to-adapty) to instantly pull statistics.

Let's quickly go through each part.

:::info
Your subscribers will migrate automatically

All users who have ever activated subscription will move as soon as they open a new version with Adapty SDK. The subscription status validation and premium access will be restored automatically.

### Installing Adapty SDK

Install Adapty SDK for your platform ([iOS](sdk-installation-ios), [Android](sdk-installation-android), [React Native](sdk-installation-reactnative), [Flutter](sdk-installation-flutter), [Unity](sdk-installation-unity)) in your app and replace your legacy logic with appropriate methods from Adapty SDK. Core things you need to replace:

- Checking an [Access level](access-level) to open a gated content;
- Making a purchase;
- Restoring purchase;
- Getting/setting information about your user.

### Changing Apple server notifications

Apple and Google send us events that happen with users' subscriptions outside of the application (renewal, cancellation, pausing, refund, etc.) via [App Store server notifications](enable-app-store-server-notifications). 

Adapty can work without this URL, but you'll get a limited feature set. For example, [Integrations](events) to 3rd party services will be delayed, subscription analytics won't be in real-time, and paywall A/B testing metrics won't be accurate. 

When switching from a legacy system, sometimes you want two systems to work simultaneously for some time. In that case, you can use our [raw events forwarding](enable-app-store-server-notifications#raw-events-forwarding), where Adapty is a proxy server for your legacy system.

### Move historical data to Adapty

Moving historical data is optional and won't affect your subscribers' state. However, there are a number of reasons why it's better to do so:

1. **Analytics will work correctly instantly**. Adapty matches subscribers by original transaction ID, and we don't count events from Apple webhook without exposing them to Adapty SDK (we technically can't do it).
2. **Used data will be there**. You'll have all Adapty profiles with user properties and can use them in [Segments](segments), and [Profiles/CRM](profiles-crm). 

Follow our [tutorial](importing-historical-data-to-adapty) to send us historical data.
