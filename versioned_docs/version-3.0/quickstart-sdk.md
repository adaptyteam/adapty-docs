Integrate Adapty SDK into your app to:

- Handle purchases, receipt validation, and subscription management out of the box
- Create and test paywalls without app updates
- Get detailed purchase analytics with zero setup - cohorts, LTV, churn, and funnel analysis included
- Keep the user subscription status always up to date across app sessions and devices
- Integrate your app with marketing attribution and analytics services using just one line of code

## How does it work

For the basic implementation of the Adapty SDK, you need to take care of three things only:

1. Install and initialize the SDK.
2. Delegate handling in-app purchases to Adapty.
3. Monitor subscription status in the profile. Adapty determines subscription status, type, and expiration â€“ the SDK just consumes this info.

The order and details may vary from app to app, but basically that's it.
