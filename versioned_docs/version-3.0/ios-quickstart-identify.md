This guide will help you to log users into your app or out of it. You need to associate them with their [Adapty profiles](profiles-crm.md) to understand whether your user can see paid content or whether you should show a paywall to them, you need to get their profile using their customer user ID.

## Identify users in the app

You have two options to identify users in the app:

- After app launch: For example, you may want to identify them as they sign up or sign in. If that's the case, on the app launch, you couldn't have known their user ID, so you set it when they perform a particular action.
- On app launch: If users have logged into your app before, you may have saved their user ID, so you pass it on the Adapty SDK activation.
