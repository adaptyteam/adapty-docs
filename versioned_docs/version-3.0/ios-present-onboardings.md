If you've customized an onboarding using the builder, you don't need to worry about rendering it in your mobile app code to display it to the user. Such an onboarding contains both what should be shown within the onboarding and how it should be shown.

Before you start, ensure that:

1. You have installed [Adapty iOS SDK](installation-of-adapty-sdks.md) 3.8.0 or later.
2. You have [created an onboarding](create-onboarding.md).
3. You have added the onboarding to a [placement](placements.md).

## Present onboardings in Swift

In order to display the visual onboarding on the device screen, do the following:

1. Get the onboarding view configuration using the `.getOnboardingConfiguration` method.
2. Initialize the visual onboarding you want to display by using the  `.onboardingController` method:

   Request parameters:

   | Parameter                    | Presence | Description                                                                                                                        |
   |:-----------------------------|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **onboarding configuration** | required | An `AdaptyOnboarding` object containing all the onboarding properties. Use the [`AdaptyUI.getOnboarding`](get-onboardings) method. |
   | **delegate**                 | required | An `AdaptyOnboardingControllerDelegate` to listen to onboarding events.                                                            |

   Returns:

   | Object                         | Description                                             |
   |:-------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
   | **AdaptyOnboardingController** | An object, representing the requested onboarding screen |

3. After the object has been successfully created, you can display it on the screen of the device:

   ```swift showLineNumbers title="Swift"
   import Adapty
   import AdaptyUI
   
   // 0. Get an onboarding if you haven't done it yet     
   let onboarding = try await Adapty.getOnboarding("YOUR_PLACEMENT_ID")
   
   // 1. Obtain the onboarding view configuration:
   let configuration = try AdaptyUI.getOnboardingConfiguration(forOnboarding: onboarding)

   // 2. Create Onboarding View Controller
   let onboardingController = AdaptyUI.onboardingController(
   configuration: configuration,
   delegate: <AdaptyOnboardingControllerDelegate>
   ) 

   // 3. Present it to the user
   present(onboardingController, animated: true)
   ```

## Present onboardings in SwiftUI

To display the visual onboarding on the device screen in SwiftUI:

```swift showLineNumbers title="SwiftUI"
// 1. Obtain the onboarding view configuration:
let configuration = try AdaptyUI.getOnboardingConfiguration(forOnboarding: onboarding)

// 2. Display the Onboarding View within your view hierarchy
AdaptyOnboardingView(
    configuration: configuration,
    placeholder: { Text("Your Placeholder View") },
    onCloseAction: { action in
        // hide the onboarding view
    },
    onError: { error in
         // handle the error
    }
)
```

## Add smooth transitions between the splash screen and onboarding

By default, between the splash screen and onboarding, you will see the loading screen until the onboarding is fully loaded. However, if you want to make the transition smoother, you can customize it and either extend the splash screen or display something else.

To do this, define a placeholder (what exactly will be shown while the onboarding is being loaded). If you define a placeholder, the onboarding will be loaded in the background and automatically displayed once ready.
