When using any attribution, messaging, or analytics integrations, you might encounter some common errors. See this guide for the troubleshooting cases.

## Data discrepancy

**Reason**: This might happen because not all your users use the app version that has the Adapty SDK. 

**Solution**: To ensure the data consistency, you can force your users to update the app to a version with the Adapty SDK.

## Network errors

**Reason**: It’s most likely because there was no internet connection between the Adapty server and the integration server. 

**Solution**: These issues usually don’t persist long and only affect a small number of events.

## Integration server failed to process the event

**Reason**: The integration is set up incorrectly.

**Solution**: See the article about the integration in our documentation. Ensure you have completed all the setup steps both in the Adapty dashboard, on the third-party tool side, and in your app code.

## Missing integration data

**Reason**: The profile is missing some integration-specific ID. This might happen when the integration is not set up properly in the app code.

**Solution**: See the article about the integration in our documentation. Ensure you have implemented methods from the code snippets in your app code, and these methods actually interact with your user profiles.

## Missing integration credentials

**Reason**: Some integration credentials are missing or incorrect.

**Solution**: Please check all the credentials for that integration on the Adapty dashboard. The issue might occur due to version or environment mismatch.

## The event has expired

**Reason**: The **Exclude historical events** option is enabled in the integration settings, and the event's creation date precedes the profile creation date in our system.

This can happen if a chain of transactions starting many years ago comes to Adapty through receipt validation for a profile created recently.

**Solution**: Make sure that it doesn’t happen for new events. If you want to send historical events to the integration, disable **Exclude historical events**.

## Disabled/unsupported event type

**Reason**: Either the event is not supported for this integration, or you have disabled it when setting up the integration. For example, `access_level_updated` events are not supported by most integrations.

**Solution**: Check in the integration documentation whether the integration support this event type. If it does, in the Adapty dashboard, ensure that this event type is enabled in the integration settings.
