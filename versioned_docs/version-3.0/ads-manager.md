:::important
Before you start using the Ads Manager, ensure you have completed the steps from [this guide](ads-manager.md).
:::

Apple Ads Manager lets you do three important things in one place:

- **See what really makes money** – explore campaign, ad group, and keyword performance directly linked to installs, trials, subscriptions, and revenue.
- **Launch and restructure fast** – create and edit campaigns, ad groups, keywords, negatives without switching to the native console.
- **Automate routine work** – set up rules that automatically adjust bids and budgets to hit your target CPA/ROAS instead of doing it manually.
