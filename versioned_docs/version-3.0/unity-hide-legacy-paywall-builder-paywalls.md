While Paywall Builder seamlessly handles the purchasing process upon clicking "buy" buttons, you have to manage the closure of paywall screens within your Unity app.

:::warning
This guide covers only hiding **legacy Paywall Builder paywalls** which supports Adapty SDK v2.x or earlier. 
:::

You can hide a paywall view by calling the `view.Dismiss` method.

```csharp showLineNumbers
view.Dismiss((error) => {
  // handle the error
});
```
