TestFlight lets your team test your app on real devices and provide feedback. Testers use their real Apple accounts, and all testing is conducted in a sandbox environment. This means transactions and purchases won't incur charges. Testing with TestFlight in the sandbox environment is ideal for team-based testing. For more information, check out [Apple's documentation on Beta testing with TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/).

:::warning
Test on a real device

To validate the complete purchase process, testing on a real device is crucial. While simulators help examine paywalls, they can't interact with Apple's servers, so you won't be able to test purchases.

## Before you start testing

Ensure the following prerequisites are met before testing in-app purchases:

1. Your Apple Developer Program account is active. Learn more in [Apple's guide on enrolling](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll).
2. Your Account Holder has signed the Paid Applications Agreement. Details are available in [Apple's guide on managing agreements](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-agreements/sign-and-update-agreements).
3. Product information is set up in App Store Connect for the app you're testing, including a product reference name, product ID, localized name, and price.
4. The **Keychain Sharing** capability is disabled. Learn more in [Apple's guide on configuring keychain sharing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-keychain-sharing).
5. You're using a development-signed build of your app, not a production-signed one.
6. All steps in the [release checklist](release-checklist) are complete.
7. Youâ€™ve reviewed how subscription renewals work in TestFlight. Renewals are accelerated: subscriptions renew daily (up to 6 times within a week), regardless of the subscription's duration. See the [official Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/subscription-renewal-rate-in-testflight) for details.

## Prepare for testing with TestFlight

When testing purchases in TestFlight, always use a real device and your actual Apple account. Transactions won't incur charges when using a development-signed build.

Follow these steps to test beta versions of your app with TestFlight:

1. Build your mobile app and send it to TestFlight via App Store Connect without releasing it.
2. Install the [TestFlight app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?mt=8) on your iOS device.
3. Share the link to your app with testers, and open the link on the test device.
4. If you're a new tester, tap **Accept** to join.
5. Tap **Install** to install the app on your device.

Your app is now installed and ready for testing.

## Make purchase

Use a paywall in your app to make a test purchase.

Once the purchase is complete, [validate the test purchase](validate-test-purchases) to confirm it was successful.

## Subscriptions in TextFlight

Keep in mind that in TestFlight, subscription renewals happen daily, regardless of the subscription's actual duration. Each subscription can renew up to six times within one week. For more details, refer to the [official Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/subscription-renewal-rate-in-testflight).

| Production subscription period | Sandbox subscription renewal | TestFlight subscription renewal |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 3 days                         | 2 minutes                    | 1 day                           |
| 1 week                         | 3 minutes                    | 1 day                           |
| 1 month                        | 5 minutes                    | 1 day                           |
| 2 months                       | 10 minutes                   | 1 day                           |
| 3 months                       | 15 minutes                   | 1 day                           |
| 6 months                       | 30 minutes                   | 1 day                           |
| 1 year                         | 1 hour                       | 1 day                           |

:::note

**Example scenario:** If you start a 1-month subscription on February 1st, it'll renew every 24 hours for a total of 6 renewals before being canceled. Since subscriptions renew at an accelerated rate in TestFlight, you'll see a new transaction for each renewal on February 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th. The subscription's auto-renewal will then be disabled on February 8th.
