The Billing issue converted chart displays the daily number of subscriptions that entered the [Billing Issue](billing-issue) state, and were renewed before the end of the billing cycle.

### Calculation

The Billing issue converted chart displays the number of subscriptions that entered the [Billing Issue](billing-issue) state in the current billing cycle, and were renewed on the day.

A subscription enters the Billing Issue state when the store (e.g. Apple, Google) is unable to process payment from the subscriber for some reason, such as an expired credit card or insufficient funds. During the Billing Issue state, the subscription is not considered active, and if the Grace Period feature is enabled in the store settings, the subscription will only move to the Billing Issue state after the Grace Period has expired.

### Available filters

### Billing issue converted chart usage

By monitoring resolution trends over time, you can identify patterns in payment recovery and assess the impact of changes to your payment retry logic or communication strategies during billing issues.
