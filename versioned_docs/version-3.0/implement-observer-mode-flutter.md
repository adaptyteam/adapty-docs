If you already have your own purchase infrastructure and aren't ready to fully switch to Adapty, you can explore [Observer mode](observer-vs-full-mode). In its basic form, Observer Mode offers advanced analytics and seamless integration with attribution and analytics systems.

If this meets your needs, you only need to:
1. Turn it on when configuring the Adapty SDK by setting the `observerMode` parameter to `true`. Follow the setup instructions for [Flutter](sdk-installation-flutter#configure-adapty-sdk).
2. [Report transactions](report-transactions-observer-mode-flutter) from your existing purchase infrastructure to Adapty.

## Observer mode setup

Turn on the Observer mode if you handle purchases and subscription status yourself and use Adapty for sending subscription events and analytics.

:::important
When running in Observer mode, Adapty SDK won't close any transactions, so make sure you're handling it.
:::

```dart showLineNumbers title="main.dart"
await Adapty().activate(
  configuration: AdaptyConfiguration(apiKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_SDK_KEY')
    ..withObserverMode(true) // Enable observer mode
    ..withLogLevel(AdaptyLogLevel.verbose),
);
```

Parameters:

| Parameter                   | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| observerMode                | A boolean value that controls [Observer mode](observer-vs-full-mode). The default value is `false`.  |

## Using Adapty paywalls in Observer Mode

If you also want to use Adapty's paywalls and A/B testing features, you can â€” but it requires some extra setup in Observer mode. Here's what you'll need to do in addition to the steps above:

1. Display paywalls as usual for [remote config paywalls](present-remote-config-paywalls-flutter).
3. [Associate paywalls](report-transactions-observer-mode-flutter) with purchase transactions.
