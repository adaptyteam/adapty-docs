A **Segment** is a set of filters that groups users with shared properties. Use segments to target paywalls and A/B tests more effectively.

After you create a segment, you can [use it as an **audience** in Placements and A/B tests](audience) to control which paywall users see (single or multiple). Examples:

- Show a standard paywall to non‑subscribers and offer a discount to users who previously canceled a subscription or trial.
- Display different paywalls to users from different countries.
- Target users based on Apple Search Ads attribution data.
- Ensure users on older app versions keep seeing the existing paywall, while newer versions get the updated one.
- [In Analytics](controls-filters-grouping-compare-proceeds.md#filtering-and-grouping), filter by segments to view performance for specific user groups. Group by segment to compare performance or contribution within **All users**.

## Creation

To create a segment, enter a name and select the attributes that define its filters.

  <img src={require('./img/1af9744-new_cohort.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

## Available attributes

:::note
While many user attributes are set automatically (like **Country** or **Calculated total revenue USD**), **Age**, **App user ID**, **Attribution** data, **Gender**, and **Custom attributes** are not defined automatically. You must [set user attributes](setting-user-attributes.md) or [pass the attribution data](attribution-integration.md) if you want to use it for segmentation.
:::

:::tip
For date-based attributes, you can filter using:

- **Fixed date**: Select specific dates from a calendar (e.g., show a special offer to users who installed between Black Friday and Cyber Monday)
- **Relative range**: Set dynamic time windows like "Last 7 days" or "Last 3 months" (e.g., re-engage users who were last seen 30+ days ago, or target recent installs)

Relative ranges automatically update, making them ideal for ongoing campaigns. Fixed dates work best for time-bound promotions.

| Attribute                                               | Filter by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Age**                                                 | The user's age. Note that age is calculated when Adapty first receives it and is not updated later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **App User ID**                                         | The user's identifier in your app ([customer_user_id](profiles-crm#user-properties)). You can filter by its presence or absence, for example, to show a paywall only to users who haven’t logged in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **App version (current)**                               | The current version of the app installed on the user's device where Adapty last received event data. When creating a segment, select a pencil icon next to **App version** and add a new version so you can use it right away.<br/> Using the **version > X.X** condition lets you measure the conversion impact of all app versions older or newer than a specific one without listing each version individually.                                            |
| **App version (on install)**                            | The version of the app installed on the user's device, when Adapty receieved event data for the first time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Attribution: Ad Group**                               | The attribution ad group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Possible values: `iOS`, `macOS`, `iPadOS`, `visionOS`, `Android`. <br/> If users access your app from multiple platforms (e.g., iOS and Android), segment membership is evaluated separately for each platform using the latest data from that specific device. This allows for platform-specific targeting even for the same user profile.                                                                                   |

| **[Custom attributes](profiles-crm#custom-attributes)** | Define your own attributes to create highly targeted segments based on properties unique to your app or business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |


## Custom attributes

Define custom attributes to build more targeted segments based on properties unique to your app or business.

:::note
- You can set up custom attributes in the mobile SDK or the Adapty Dashboard. For SDK setup, follow the instructions [here](setting-user-attributes#custom-user-attributes).
- Changing a custom attribute after it's used in a segment may unsync the user from that segment in [analytics](controls-filters-grouping-compare-proceeds.md#filtering-and-grouping). Data will reflect the previous value.

### How to configure a custom attribute

In the Adapty Dashboard, select **Create custom attributes** from the attribute dropdown menu.

  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}

| Field  | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ------ |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**   | A label for the custom attribute, used only in the Adapty Dashboard.                                                                 |
| **Key**    | A unique identifier for the attribute. This must match the key used in the SDK.                                                      |
| **Type**   | Choose between:<ul><li>String: Requires a predefined list of possible values.</li><li>Number: Accepts only numeric values.</li></ul> |
| **Values** | If you select `String`, enter the list of possible values. If you choose `Number`, the attribute will only accept numeric input. Numeric attributes support decimal values and can be used with comparison operators.    |

After you fill in the required fields, you can use custom attributes in your segments, [A/B tests](ab-tests), and more.

Each profile can have up to 30 custom attributes.

## Total number and random sample

After you create a segment, Adapty shows the total number of users that match the segment criteria.

Adapty also shows a random sample of 40 users who fit the criteria. Use it to test your segment and ensure it’s configured correctly.
