## Using Paywall Templates

Templates serve as a fantastic starting point, offering beautifully structured layouts and visual appeal. You can either use them as they are or make slight modifications to align them with your brand's aesthetics. Here’s why ready-made templates are a smart choice:

- **Time-Saving**: Quickly set up a professional-looking paywall without the need for extensive design work.
- **Consistency**: Ensure a cohesive look that aligns with proven design standards.
- **Customizability**: Personalize each template with your brand elements to make it uniquely yours.

For those who prefer a hands-on approach, templates with a minimal design offer a blank canvas. These templates come with basic placements, making it easier for you to unleash your creativity and build a paywall from scratch using Adapty's versatile, feature-rich, and user-friendly paywall builder.

    border: 'none', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */

## Choose paywall template

When creating a new paywall, Adapty offers a selection of templates. You can easily switch between templates at any moment after that; however, it’s important to note that replacing a template will discard any changes made to your paywall design. To avoid losing your work, we recommend duplicating the paywall before changing templates so that you could return to the saved paywall if needed.

1. In the **Layout settings** of the paywall, click the **Change template** button.

   
<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/24a8f3b-PB_change_template.png').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>



2. In the opened **Choose paywall** window, browse and select a new template.

   
<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/984a1e9-PB_select_template.png').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>



3. Click the **Choose** button to confirm the template change. Please note that replacing a template will discard any changes made to your paywall design.
