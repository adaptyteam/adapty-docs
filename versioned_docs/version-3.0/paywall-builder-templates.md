This section describes the new Paywall Builder, which works with iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs version 3.0 or higher, and Flutter and Unity SDKs version 3.3.0 or higher. For information on the legacy Paywall Builder compatible with Adapty SDK v2.x or earlier, see [Legacy Paywall Builder templates](paywall-builder-templates-legacy).

## Use paywall templates

Templates serve as a fantastic starting point, offering beautifully structured layouts and visual appeal. You can either use them as they are or make slight modifications to align them with your brand's aesthetics. 

Here's why ready-made templates are a smart choice:

- **Time-Saving**: Quickly set up a professional-looking paywall without the need for extensive design work.
- **Consistency**: Ensure a cohesive look that aligns with proven design standards.
- **Customizability**: Personalize each template with your brand elements to make it uniquely yours.

For those who prefer a hands-on approach, templates with a minimal design offer a blank canvas. These templates come with basic placements, making it easier for you to unleash your creativity and build a paywall from scratch using Adapty's versatile, feature-rich, and user-friendly Paywall Builder.

  <img src={require('./img/eba907e-PB_templates_minimal_design.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: 'none', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>

## Choose paywall template

When creating a new paywall, Adapty offers a selection of templates and a [built-in AI generator](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/paywall-builder-templates#generate-paywalls-with-ai). You can easily switch between templates at any moment after that. 

However, it's important to note that replacing a template will discard any changes made to your paywall design. To avoid losing your work, we recommend duplicating the paywall before changing templates so you can return to the saved paywall if needed.

1. Go to the **Layout settings** of the paywall.
2. Click **Change template**.

<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/change-template.png').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

3. In the opened **Choose paywall** window, browse and select a new template.

<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/984a1e9-PB_select_template.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

4. Click **Choose** to confirm the template change. Please note that replacing a template will discard any changes made to your paywall design.


## Generate paywalls with AI

For apps published on the App Store, you can create a unique, high-converting paywall tailored to your app in just seconds using our built-in AI generator.

To do so:

1. In the **Layout settings** of the paywall, click **Change template**.
2. CLick **Generate template** on the top of the template selection page.
3. Paste your App Store link and click **Generate paywall**. Generation may take some time.
4. Choose one of the 5 generated templates, or click **Generate new variation** if none of them fit your needs.
5. Click **Pick & Open in Builder**.

The selected template will be applied to your paywall.

:::note

Each user can generate up to 5 sets of templates per day.
