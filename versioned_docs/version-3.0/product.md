In Adapty, products are everything you sell in your app — subscriptions, consumables, non-consumables, lifetime unlocks, coins, credits, or any other purchasable content.

With Adapty, you don’t need to create and maintain separate products for each platform. One product in Adapty works across all stores and payment platforms, so you can unify your in-app offering and avoid duplication.

Products connect to your monetization flow step by step:

- A **product** is added to a **[paywall](paywalls.md)** — that’s how you decide what to offer and how to present it.

- A **paywall** is added to a **[placement](placements.md)** — that’s how you control where and when users see it.

- A **placement** can target different **[audiences](audience.md)** — that’s how you customize paywalls, run experiments, and optimize performance across user groups.

Make sure you've [done the initial configuration](quickstart) without skipping a single step and [created the products in the App Store](app-store-products) and/or [created products in Google Play](android-products) before adding them in the Adapty Dashboard.
