Adapty SDK has its own wrapper for all kinds of errors, called `AdaptyError`. Basically, every error returned by an SDK is `AdaptyError`. It has two useful properties: `originalError` and `adaptyErrorCode`, described below.

**originalError** contains an original error in case you need the original one to work with. Can be [SKError](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerror), [NSError](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nserror) or just general Swift [Error](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/error). This property is optional since some errors can be generated directly by SDK, like inconsistent or missing data, and won't have the original error around which the wrapper was initially built.

**adaptyErrorCode** can be used to handle common issues, like:

- invalid credentials
- network errors
- cancelled payments
- billing issues
- invalid receipt
- and much more

It's pretty easy to check the error for specific codes and react to them accordingly.

```swift showLineNumbers title="Swift"
do {
    let info = try await Adapty.makePurchase(product: product)
} catch {
    if error.adaptyErrorCode == .paymentCancelled {
        // purchase was cancelled
        // you can offer discount to your user or remind them later
    }
}
```

## Other issues

If you haven't found a solution yet, the next steps can be:

- **Upgrading the SDK to the latest version**: We always recommend upgrading to the latest SDK versions since they are more stable and include fixes for known issues.
- **Contact the support team via [support@adapty.io](mailto:support@adapty.io) or via the chat**: If you are not ready to upgrade the SDK or it didn't help, contact our support team. Note that your issue will be resolved faster if you [enable verbose logging](sdk-installation-ios#logging) and share logs with the team. You can also attach relevant code snippets.
