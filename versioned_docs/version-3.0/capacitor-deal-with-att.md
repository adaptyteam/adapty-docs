If your application uses AppTrackingTransparency framework and presents an app-tracking authorization request to the user, then you should send the [authorization status](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency/attrackingmanager/authorizationstatus/) to Adapty.

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { adapty, AppTrackingTransparencyStatus } from '@adapty/capacitor';

try {
  await adapty.updateProfile({
    appTrackingTransparencyStatus: AppTrackingTransparencyStatus.Authorized,
  });
  console.log('ATT status updated successfully');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to update ATT status:', error);
}
```

:::warning
We strongly recommend that you send this value as early as possible when it changes, only in that case the data will be sent in a timely manner to the integrations you have configured.
