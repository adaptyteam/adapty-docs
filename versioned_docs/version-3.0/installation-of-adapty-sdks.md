Adapty comprises two crucial SDK modules for seamless integration into your mobile app:

- Main **AdaptySDK**: This is a fundamental, mandatory SDK necessary for the proper functioning of Adapty within your app.
- **AdaptyUI SDK**: This optional module becomes necessary if you use the Adapty Paywall Builder, a user-friendly, no-code tool for easily creating cross-platform paywalls. These paywalls are built in a visual constructor right in our dashboard, run entirely natively on the device, and require minimal effort from you to create something that performs well.

The Adapty SDK installation and configuration depend on your framework, so refer to the following doc topics for detailed guidance:

- [iOS](sdk-installation-ios)
- [Android](sdk-installation-android)
- [Flutter](sdk-installation-flutter)
- [React Native](sdk-installation-reactnative) 
- [Unity](sdk-installation-unity)
