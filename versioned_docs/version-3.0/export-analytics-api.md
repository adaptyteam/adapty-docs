Exporting your analytics data to CSV gives you the flexibility to dive deeper into your appâ€™s performance metrics, customize reports, and analyze trends over time. With the Adapty API, you can easily pull detailed analytics into a CSV format, making it convenient to track, share, and refine your data insights as needed.

## Getting started with the API for analytics export

With the analytics export API, you can, for example:

1. **Analyze MRR from Marketing Campaigns**: Measure the impact of last year's marketing campaigns in a specific country to see which ones brought in the highest revenue, with weekly tracking. Use the [Retrieve analytics data](export-analytics-api-retrieve-analytics-data) method for this.

2. **Track Cohort Retention Over Time**: Follow retention by cohort to spot drop-off points and compare cohorts over time, revealing trends and key moments where engagement strategies could boost retention. Limited to a specific app store, a specific country, and a particular product. Use the [Retrieve cohort data](export-analytics-api-retrieve-cohort-data) method for this.

3. **Evaluate Conversion Rates Across Channels**: Analyze conversion rates for key acquisition channels to see which are most effective in driving first-time purchases. This helps prioritize marketing spending on high-performing channels. Use the [Retrieve conversion data](export-analytics-api-retrieve-conversion-data) method for this.

4. **Review Churn Rate**: Monitor how quickly users are unsubscribing to uncover churn patterns or gauge the success of retention efforts, focusing on a specific country and a specific product. Use the [Retrieve funnel data](export-analytics-api-retrieve-funnel-data) method for this.

5. **Assess LTV by User Segment**: Identify the lifetime value of different user segments to understand which groups bring in the highest revenue over time. Focus on high-value segments like long-term subscribers, and use the results to refine acquisition strategies. Use the [Retrieve LTV data](export-analytics-api-retrieve-ltv) method for this.

6. **Check Retention by Country**: Look at retention rates by region to find high-engagement markets and guide localization or regional strategies. Use the [Retrieve retention data](export-analytics-api-retrieve-retention-data) method for this.
