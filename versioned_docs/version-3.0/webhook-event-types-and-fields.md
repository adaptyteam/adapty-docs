import WebhookEvents from '@site/src/components/reusable/WebhookEvents.md';

Adapty sends webhooks in response to subscription events. This section defines these event types and the data contained in each webhook.

## Webhook event types

You can send all event types to your webhook or choose only some of them. You can consult our [Event flows](event-flows) to learn what kind of incoming data to expect and how to build your business logic around it. You can disable the event types you do not need when you [set up your Webhook integration](set-up-webhook-integration#configure-webhook-integration-in-the-adapty-dashboard). There, you can also replace Adapty default event IDs with your own if required.

<WebhookEvents />

## Webhook event structure

Adapty will send you only those events you've chosen in the **Events names** section of the [Integrations ->  Webhooks](https://app.adapty.io/integrations/customwebhook) page.

Webhook events are serialized in JSON. The body of a `POST` request to your server will contain the serialized event wrapped into the structure below. All events follow the same structure, but their fields vary based on the event type, store, and your specific configuration. User attributes are the [custom user attributes](setting-user-attributes#custom-user-attributes) you set up, so they contain what you've configured. Attribution data fields are the same for all event types as well, however, the list of attributions will depend on which attribution sources you use in your mobile app. See below an example of an event:

### Play Store purchase token

This field includes all the data needed to revalidate a purchase, if necessary. It is sent only if the **Send Play Store purchase token** option is enabled in the [Webhook integration settings](https://app.adapty.io/integrations/customwebhook).

| Field               | Type    | Description                                                  |

### Event Properties

Event properties can vary depending on the event type and even between events of the same type. For instance, an event originating from the App Store won’t include Android-specific properties like `base_plan_id`.

The [Access Level Updated](webhook-event-types-and-fields#for-access-level-updated-event) event has distinct properties, so we’ve dedicated a separate section to it. Similarly, we’ve separated [Additional tax and revenue event properties](webhook-event-types-and-fields#additional-tax-and-revenue-event-properties), as they are specific to only certain event types.

#### For most event types

The event properties for most event types are consistent (except for **Access Level Updated** event, which is described in its own section). Below is a comprehensive table highlighting properties and indicating if they belong to specific events.
