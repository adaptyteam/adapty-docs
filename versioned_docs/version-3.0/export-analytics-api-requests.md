Exporting your analytics data to CSV gives you the flexibility to dive deeper into your appâ€™s performance metrics, customize reports, and analyze trends over time. With the Adapty API, you can easily pull detailed analytics into a CSV format, making it convenient to track, share, and refine your data insights as needed.

## Postman collection and environment

To simplify using our API for exporting analytics data, we've prepared a Postman collection and an environment file you can download and import into Postman.

- **Request Collection**: Includes all requests available in the Adapty analytics export API. Note that it uses variables that you can define in the environment.
- **Environment**: Contains a list of variables where you can define values once. We've prepared a unified environment for the server-side API, web API, and analytics export API to make things easier for you. After making this environment active, Postman will automatically substitute the defined variable values in your requests.
