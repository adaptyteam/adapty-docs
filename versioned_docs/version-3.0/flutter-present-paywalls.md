If you've customized a paywall using the Paywall Builder, you don't need to worry about rendering it in your mobile app code to display it to the user. Such a paywall contains both what should be shown within the paywall and how it should be shown.

:::warning

This guide is for **new Paywall Builder paywalls** only which require SDK v3.2.0 or later. The process for presenting paywalls differs for paywalls designed with different versions of Paywall Builde and remote config paywalls.

- For presenting **Legacy Paywall Builder paywalls**, check out [Flutter - Present legacy Paywall Builder paywalls](flutter-present-paywalls-legacy).
- For presenting **Remote config paywalls**, see [Render paywall designed by remote config](present-remote-config-paywalls).

:::

To display a paywall, use the `view.present()` method on the `view` created by the `createPaywallView` method. Each `view` can only be used once. If you need to display the paywall again, call `createPaywallView` one more to create a new `view` instance. 

:::warning

Reusing the same `view` without recreating it may result in an `AdaptyUIError.viewAlreadyPresented` error.
:::

```typescript showLineNumbers title="Flutter"
try {
  await view.present();
} on AdaptyError catch (e) {
  // handle the error
} catch (e) {
  // handle the error
}
```
<SampleApp />

## Show dialog

Use this method instead of native alert dialogs when a paywall view is presented on Android. On Android, regular alerts appear behind the paywall view, which makes them invisible to users. This method ensures proper dialog presentation above the paywall on all platforms.

```dart showLineNumbers title="Flutter"
try {
  final action = await view.showDialog(
    title: 'Close paywall?',
    content: 'You will lose access to exclusive offers.',
    primaryActionTitle: 'Stay',
    secondaryActionTitle: 'Close',
  );
  
  if (action == AdaptyUIDialogActionType.secondary) {
    // User confirmed - close the paywall
    await view.dismiss();
  }
  // If primary - do nothing, user stays
} catch (e) {
  // handle error
}
```
