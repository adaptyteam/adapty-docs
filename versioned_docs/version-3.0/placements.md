In Adapty, placements are points in your app where you show a [paywall](paywalls.md) or an [onboarding](onboardings.md). A placement can be anything from a button tap on the home screen, to the end of a free trial, to the first launch of the app.

With placements, you don’t need to hardcode which paywall or onboarding is displayed. The only thing you hardcode is the placement ID — everything else can be managed from the dashboard without redeploying your app.

Placements give you flexibility to:

- **Run [A/B tests](ab-tests.md)**: Compare different paywalls or onboardings and see which performs best.

- **Target user groups**: Show different content to different [audiences](audience.md) (e.g., new vs. returning users, or based on country).

This way, you can experiment, personalize, and optimize your monetization flow — all without touching the app code.
