If you've customized an onboarding using the builder, you don't need to worry about rendering it in your mobile app code to display it to the user. Such an onboarding contains both what should be shown within the onboarding and how it should be shown.

Before you start, ensure that:

1. You have installed [Adapty React Native SDK](installation-of-adapty-sdks.md) 3.7.0 or later.
2. You have [created an onboarding](create-onboarding.md).
3. You have added the onboarding to a [placement](placements.md).

To display an onboarding, use the `view.present()` method on the `view` created by the `createOnboardingView` method. Each `view` can only be used once. If you need to display the onboarding again, call `createOnboardingView` one more time to create a new `view` instance.

:::warning

Reusing the same `view` without recreating it may result in an `AdaptyUIError.viewAlreadyPresented` error.
:::

```typescript showLineNumbers title="React Native (TSX)"
import { createOnboardingView } from 'react-native-adapty/dist/ui';

const view = await createOnboardingView(onboarding);

view.registerEventHandlers(); // handle close press, etc

try {
  await view.present();
} catch (error) {
  // handle the error
}
```
