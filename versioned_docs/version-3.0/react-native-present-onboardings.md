If you've customized an onboarding using the builder, you don't need to worry about rendering it in your mobile app code to display it to the user. Such an onboarding contains both what should be shown within the onboarding and how it should be shown.

Before you start, ensure that:

1. You have installed [Adapty React Native SDK](installation-of-adapty-sdks.md) 3.8.0 or later.
2. You have [created an onboarding](create-onboarding.md).
3. You have added the onboarding to a [placement](placements.md).

Adapty React Native SDK provides two ways to present onboardings:

- **Standalone screen**: Modal presentation that can be dismissed by users through native platform gestures (swipe, back button). Best for optional onboardings where users should be able to skip or dismiss the content.

- **Embedded component**: Embedded component gives you complete control over dismissal through your own UI and logic. Ideal for required onboardings where you want to ensure users complete the flow before proceeding.

## Present as standalone screen

To display an onboarding as a standalone screen that users can dismiss, use the `view.present()` method on the `view` created by the `createOnboardingView` method. Each `view` can only be used once. If you need to display the onboarding again, call `createOnboardingView` one more time to create a new `view` instance.

:::warning
Reusing the same `view` without recreating it may result in an `AdaptyUIError.viewAlreadyPresented` error.
:::

:::note
This approach is best for optional onboardings where users should have the freedom to dismiss the screen using native gestures (swipe down on iOS, back button on Android). To present a full-screen onboarding, [embed it in the component hierarchy](#embed-in-component-hierarchy).
:::

```typescript showLineNumbers title="React Native (TSX)"
import { createOnboardingView } from 'react-native-adapty/dist/ui';

const view = await createOnboardingView(onboarding);

view.registerEventHandlers(); // handle close press, etc

try {
    await view.present();
} catch (error) {
    // handle the error
}
```



## Embed in component hierarchy

To embed an onboarding within your existing component tree, use the `AdaptyOnboardingView` component directly in your React Native component hierarchy. This approach gives you full control over when and how the onboarding can be dismissed.

:::note
This approach is ideal for required onboardings, mandatory tutorials, or any flow where you need to ensure users complete the onboarding before proceeding. You can control dismissal through your own UI elements and logic.
:::

```typescript showLineNumbers title="React Native (TSX)"
import { AdaptyOnboardingView } from 'react-native-adapty/dist/ui';

<AdaptyOnboardingView
  onboarding={onboarding}
  style={{ /* your styles */ }}
  eventHandlers={{
    onAnalytics(event, meta) { 
      // Handle analytics events
    },
    onClose(actionId, meta) { 
      // Handle close actions
    },
    onCustom(actionId, meta) { 
      // Handle custom actions
    },
    onPaywall(actionId, meta) { 
      // Handle paywall actions
    },
    onStateUpdated(action, meta) { 
      // Handle state updates
    },
    onFinishedLoading(meta) { 
      // Handle when onboarding finishes loading
    },
    onError(error) { 
      // Handle errors
    },
  }}
/>
```

Once you've presented your onboarding, you'll want to [handle user interactions and events](react-native-handling-onboarding-events.md). Learn how to handle onboarding events to respond to user actions and track analytics.
