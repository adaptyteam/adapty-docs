To get started with Adapty, first integrate with the stores where your users make their purchases. Adapty lets you manage subscriptions and purchases from both your mobile app and website in one place, so you can also integrate with web payment platforms.

## Integrate with stores and web payments

Choose your store below for detailed integration steps:

- <a href="https://adapty.io/docs/initial-ios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>: Link Adapty using App Store Connect.
- <a href="https://adapty.io/docs/initial-android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>: Connect Adapty using the Google Play Developer API.
- Web payments:
  - <a href="https://adapty.io/docs/stripe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe</a>: Connect by installing the Adapty app in Stripe.
  - <a href="https://adapty.io/docs/paddle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paddle</a>: Connect using webhooks.
- <a href="https://adapty.io/docs/custom-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom store</a>: No initial integration needed. You can track purchases and access analytics in Adapty.

:::note
For custom stores, Adapty doesn’t validate data and doesn’t process purchases made through them. However, you can still mark purchases made through custom stores so that Adapty can grant access to paid content after a successful purchase, reflect transactions in your analytics, and share them via integrations.
