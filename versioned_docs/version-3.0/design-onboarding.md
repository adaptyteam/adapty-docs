The no-code mobile app onboarding builder is a powerful and customizable tool that will help you provide your users with the best onboarding experience. You don't even need to be a developer or designer to get a great result.

The onboarding scenarios we fully support, both standalone and in combination with each other, are:

- Demonstrating the app value and benefits along with client testimonials and stylish visuals.
- Showing your clients how to use the app and get the most out of it.
- Leading users to purchase or trial.

## Onboarding screens

The onboarding flow consists of several screens that you add and design.

Users will tap the button to navigate between them.

:::tip
If some of your users need a slightly different flow (for example, in your fitness app, you might want to show different 'goal' pictures based on the user's gender), you don't need to create separate onboardings. Instead, you can make some screens hidden by default and displayed only for some scenarios.

## Onboarding elements

The onboarding elements are displayed on the left in the order they are displayed. Click **Add** at the top right to add a new element.

There are the following groups of elements you can add:

- **Containers**: Containers allow you to set up a flexible layout. For example, if you want to add a two-column text, you need to add **Columns** and then drag two text blocks into **Columns** on the left pane. Or, if you are adding a carousel, you'll need to add images to the **Media** elements inside.
- **Typography**: Add pre-formatted text blocks and configure their look as needed.
- **Media & Display**: Except for images and videos, you can add animated charts that demonstrate your app value and encourage users.
:::tip
As a part of the **Media & Display** group, you can also add custom HTML code if the provided customization options are not enough.
