Adapty User Acquisition (Adapty UA) connects your ad spend with subscription revenue (in-app and web purchases) to give you complete user acquisition analytics. This helps you:

- Calculate ROAS (return on ad spend) across all your channels
- See your entire app economy in one place
- Get accurate attribution data for better decisions

## Why Adapty UA?

Measuring user acquisition performance is challenging. Data is often scattered across platforms, attribution becomes difficult due to privacy changes, and building custom solutions takes significant time.

Adapty UA provides built-in attribution and unified analytics. You can focus on growing your app instead of managing data systems.
