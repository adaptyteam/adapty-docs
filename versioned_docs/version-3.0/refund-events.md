The Refund events chart displays the number of refunded purchases and subscriptions. Adapty attributes refund events to the moment when the refund occured, meaning that any refunds related to a subscription will be counted on an actual date of the refund and not on the start date of the subscription.

### Calculation

Adapty calculates refund events by tracking the number of refunded purchases and subscriptions over a selected period of time. Refunds are attributed to the moment when they occured (not to when the subscription started), and any refunds that occur during the selected time period will be included in the refund events count. It's important to note that refunds related to trials are not included in this count, as trials have no revenue associated with them and cannot be refunded.

### Available filters and grouping

- ✅ Filter by: Attribution, country, paywall, store, product, and duration.
