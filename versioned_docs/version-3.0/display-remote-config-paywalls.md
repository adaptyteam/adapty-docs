With Adapty, you can configure paywalls remotely and define the products your app will display—no need to hardcode the products. The only thing you’ll need to hardcode is the [placement ID](placements).

There are two ways to customize a paywall in the Adapty Dashboard:

- The no-code [**Paywall Builder**](adapty-paywall-builder)
- The flexible [**remote config**](customize-paywall-with-remote-config), a JSON file that contains the data needed to render the paywall on the device

This guide covers **Remote Config paywalls** only. The process for displaying and handling interactive elements is different for Paywall Builder paywalls. If you’d like to learn more about that, check out the [Display paywalls designed with Paywall Builder](display-pb-paywalls) guide.
