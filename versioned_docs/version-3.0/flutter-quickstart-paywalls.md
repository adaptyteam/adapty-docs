To enable any kind of in-app purchases, you need to understand how Adapty structures purchases:

- **Products** are anything available for purchase â€“ subscriptions, consumables, or lifetime access.
- **Paywalls** are configurations that define which products to offer. In Adapty, paywalls are the only way to retrieve products, but this design lets you modify offerings, pricing, and product combinations without touching your app code.

Adapty offers you three ways to enable purchases in your app. Select one of them depending on your app requirements:

| Implementation             | Complexity | When to use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

**The steps below show how to implement a paywall created in the Adapty paywall builder.**
:::

To display a paywall created in the Adapty paywall builder, in your app code, you only need to:

1. **Get the paywall**: Get the paywall from Adapty.
2. **Display the paywall and delegate handling purchases to Adapty**: Show the paywall container you've got in your app.
3. **Handle button actions**: Associate user interactions with the paywall with your app's response to them. For example, open links or close the paywall when users click buttons.


## 1. Get the paywall

Your paywalls are associated with placements configured in the dashboard. Placements allow you to run different paywalls for different audiences or to run [A/B tests](ab-tests.md).

That's why, to get a paywall to display, you need to:

1. Get the `paywall` object by the [placement](placements.md) ID using the `getPaywall` method and check whether it is a paywall created in the builder using the `hasViewConfiguration` property.

2. Create the paywall view using the `createPaywallView` method. The view contains the UI elements and styling needed to display the paywall.


```dart showLineNumbers
import 'package:adapty_flutter/adapty_flutter.dart';

try {
  final paywall = await Adapty().getPaywall(placementId: "YOUR_PLACEMENT_ID", locale: "en");
  // the requested paywall
} on AdaptyError catch (adaptyError) {
  // handle the error
} catch (e) {
}

try {
  final view = await AdaptyUI().createPaywallView(
        paywall: paywall,
      );
} on AdaptyError catch (e) {
  // handle the error
} catch (e) {
  // handle the error
}
```

## 2. Display the paywall

Now, when you have the paywall configuration, it's enough to add a few lines to display your paywall.

To display the paywall, use the `view.present()` method on the `view` created by the `createPaywallView` method. Each `view` can only be used once. If you need to display the paywall again, call `createPaywallView` one more to create a new `view` instance.

```dart showLineNumbers title="Flutter"
try {
  await view.present();
} on AdaptyError catch (e) {
  // handle the error
} catch (e) {
  // handle the error
}
```

## 3. Handle button actions

When users click buttons in the paywall, purchases and restoration are handled automatically. However, other buttons have custom or pre-defined IDs and require handling actions in your code.

To control or monitor processes on the paywall screen, implement the `AdaptyUIPaywallsEventsObserver` methods and set the observer before presenting any screen. If a user has performed some action, te `paywallViewDidPerformAction` will be invoked, and your app needs to respond depending on the action ID.

For example, your paywall probably has a close button and URLs to open (e.g., terms of use and privacy policy). So, you need to respond to actions with the `Close` and `OpenUrl` IDs.


```dart showLineNumbers title="Flutter"
class _PaywallScreenState extends State<PaywallScreen> implements AdaptyUIPaywallsEventsObserver {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Register this class as the paywalls event observer
    AdaptyUI().setPaywallsEventsObserver(this);
  }

  // This method is called when user performs an action on the paywall UI
  @override
  void paywallViewDidPerformAction(AdaptyUIPaywallView view, AdaptyUIAction action) {
    switch (action) {
      case const CloseAction():
      case const AndroidSystemBackAction():
        view.dismiss();
        break;
      case OpenUrlAction(url: final url):
        // Open the URL using url_launcher package
        _launchUrl(url);
        break;
    }
  }

  // Helper method to launch URLs
  Future<void> _launchUrl(String url) async {
    try {
      final Uri uri = Uri.parse(url);
      if (await canLaunchUrl(uri)) {
        await launchUrl(uri, mode: LaunchMode.externalApplication);
      } else {
        // Handle case where URL cannot be launched
        print('Could not launch $url');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors
      print('Error launching URL: $e');
    }
  }
}

```

## Next steps

Your paywall is ready to be displayed in the app.

Now, you need to [check the users' access level](flutter-check-subscription-status.md) to ensure you display a paywall or give access to paid features to right users.

## Full example

Here is how all those steps can be integrated in your app together.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adapty_flutter/adapty_flutter.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

void main() async {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: PaywallScreen()));
}

class PaywallScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<PaywallScreen> createState() => _PaywallScreenState();
}

class _PaywallScreenState extends State<PaywallScreen> implements AdaptyUIPaywallsEventsObserver {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Register this class as the paywalls event observer
    AdaptyUI().setPaywallsEventsObserver(this);
    _showPaywallIfNeeded();
  }

  Future<void> _showPaywallIfNeeded() async {
    try {

      final paywall = await Adapty().getPaywall(
        placementId: 'YOUR_PLACEMENT_ID',
      );

      if (!paywall.hasViewConfiguration) return;

      final view = await AdaptyUI().createPaywallView(paywall: paywall);

      await view.present();
    } catch (_) {
      // Handle any errors (network, SDK issues, etc.)
    }
  }

  // This method is called when user performs an action on the paywall UI
  @override
  void paywallViewDidPerformAction(AdaptyUIPaywallView view, AdaptyUIAction action) {
    switch (action) {
      case const CloseAction():
      case const AndroidSystemBackAction():
        view.dismiss();
        break;
      case OpenUrlAction(url: final url):
        // Open the URL using url_launcher package
        _launchUrl(url);
        break;
    }
  }

  // Helper method to launch URLs
  Future<void> _launchUrl(String url) async {
    try {
      final Uri uri = Uri.parse(url);
      if (await canLaunchUrl(uri)) {
        await launchUrl(uri, mode: LaunchMode.externalApplication);
      } else {
        // Handle case where URL cannot be launched
        print('Could not launch $url');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors
      print('Error launching URL: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Adapty Paywall Example')),
      body: Center(
        // Add a button to re-trigger the paywall for testing purposes
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _showPaywallIfNeeded,
          child: Text('Show Paywall'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```
