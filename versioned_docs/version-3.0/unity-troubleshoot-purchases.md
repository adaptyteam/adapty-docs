This guide helps you resolve common issues when implementing purchases manually in the Unity SDK.

## makePurchase is called successfully, but the profile is not being updated

**Issue**: The `makePurchase` method completes successfully, but the user's profile and subscription status are not updated in Adapty.

**Reason**: This usually indicates incomplete Google Play Store setup or configuration issues.

**Solution**: Ensure you've completed all the [Google Play setup steps](https://adapty.io/docs/initial-android).

## makePurchase is invoked twice

**Issue**: The `makePurchase` method is being called multiple times for the same purchase.

**Reason**: This typically happens when the purchase flow is triggered multiple times due to UI state management issues or rapid user interactions.

**Solution**: Ensure you've completed all the [Google Play setup steps](https://adapty.io/docs/initial-android).

## AdaptyError.cantMakePayments in observer mode

**Issue**: You're getting `AdaptyError.cantMakePayments` when using `makePurchase` in observer mode.

**Reason**: In observer mode, you should handle purchases on your side, not use Adapty's `makePurchase` method.

**Solution**: If you use `makePurchase` for purchases, turn off the observer mode. You need either to use `makePurchase` or handle purchases on your side in the observer mode. See [Implement Observer mode](implement-observer-mode-unity) for more details.

## Adapty error: (code: 103, message: Play Market request failed on purchases updated: responseCode=3, debugMessage=Billing Unavailable, detail: null)

**Issue**: You're receiving a billing unavailable error from Google Play Store.

**Reason**: This error is not related to Adapty. It's a Google Play Billing Library error indicating that billing is not available on the device.

**Solution**: This error is not related to Adapty. You can check and find out more about it in the Play Store documentation: [Handle BillingResult response codes](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/errors#billing_unavailable_error_code_3) | Play Billing | Android Developers.

## Not found makePurchasesCompletionHandlers

**Issue**: You're encountering issues with `makePurchasesCompletionHandlers` not being found.

**Reason**: This is typically related to sandbox testing issues.

**Solution**: Create a new sandbox user and try again. This often resolves sandbox-related purchase completion handler issues.

## Other issues

**Issue**: You're experiencing other purchase-related problems not covered above.

**Solution**: Migrate the SDK to the latest version using the [migration guides](unity-sdk-migration-guides) if needed. Many issues are resolved in newer SDK versions.
