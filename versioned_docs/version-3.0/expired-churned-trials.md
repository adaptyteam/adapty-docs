The Expired (churned) trials chart displays the number of trials that have expired, leaving users without access to the app's premium features. In most cases, this occurs when users decide not to pay for the app or experience billing issues.

### Calculation

Adapty calculates the number of "Expired (Churned) Trials" during a specific period by counting the number of trials that have ended and users no longer have access to premium app features. This count remains unchanged regardless of the reason for the trial's expiration, such as a user's decision not to pay for the app or billing issues.

In addition, Adapty allows you to group the chart by expiration reason, such as user-initiated cancellations or billing issues. This grouping provides valuable insights into why users are churning and enables you to take proactive measures to prevent churn and optimize your app's success.

### Available filters and grouping

- ✅ Filter by: Attribution, country, paywall, store, product, and duration. 
- ✅ Group by: Expiration reason, product, country, store, paywall, duration, attribution status, attribution channel, attribution campaign, attribution ad group, attribution ad set, and attribution creative.
