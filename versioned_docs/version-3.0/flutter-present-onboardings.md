If you've customized an onboarding using the builder, you don't need to worry about rendering it in your mobile app code to display it. Such an onboarding contains both what should be shown within the onboarding and how it should be shown.

Before you start, ensure that:

1. You have installed [Adapty Flutter SDK](installation-of-adapty-sdks.md) 3.7.0 or later.
2. You have [created an onboarding](create-onboarding.md).
3. You have added the onboarding to a [placement](placements.md).

Adapty Flutter SDK provides two ways to present onboardings:

- **Full-screen presentation (classic view)**: Best for modal-style onboardings that take over the entire screen with programmatic control over when they appear and disappear.

- **Embedded widget (platform view)**: Best for integrating onboardings seamlessly within your existing widget hierarchy, such as part of a larger screen or flow.


## Present as full-screen modal

To display an onboarding as a full-screen modal, use the `onboardingView.present()` method on the `onboardingView` created by the `createOnboardingView` method. Each `view` can only be used once. If you need to display the onboarding again, call `createOnboardingView` one more time to create a new `onboardingView` instance.

:::warning
Reusing the same `onboardingView` without recreating it may result in an `AdaptyUIError.viewAlreadyPresented` error.
:::

```javascript showLineNumbers title="Flutter"
try {
  await onboardingView.present();
} on AdaptyError catch (e) {
  // handle the error
} catch (e) {
  // handle the error
}
```

### Dismiss the onboarding

When you need to programmatically close the onboarding, use the `dismiss()` method:

```dart showLineNumbers title="Flutter"
try {
  await onboardingView.dismiss();
} on AdaptyError catch (e) {
  // handle the error
} catch (e) {
  // handle the error
}
```


## Embed in widget hierarchy

To embed an onboarding within your existing widget tree, use the `AdaptyUIOnboardingPlatformView` widget directly in your Flutter widget hierarchy:

```javascript showLineNumbers title="Flutter"
AdaptyUIOnboardingPlatformView(
  onboarding: onboarding, // The onboarding object you fetched
  onDidFinishLoading: (meta) {
  },
  onDidFailWithError: (error) {
  },
  onCloseAction: (meta, actionId) {
  },
  onPaywallAction: (meta, actionId) {
  },
  onCustomAction: (meta, actionId) {
  },
  onStateUpdatedAction: (meta, elementId, params) {
  },
  onAnalyticsEvent: (meta, event) {
  },
)
```

## Loader during onboarding

A loader is shown by default while onboarding content loads.  
You can override this in your Flutter app:

- To customize the native loader on iOS, add `AdaptyOnboardingPlaceholderView.xib` to your Xcode project.
- For full control, overlay your own widget above `AdaptyUIOnboardingPlatformView` and hide it on `onDidFinishLoading`.

This helps create seamless transitions and custom loading experiences.

Once you've presented your onboarding, you'll want to [handle user interactions and events](flutter-handling-onboarding-events.md). Learn how to handle onboarding events to respond to user actions and track analytics.
