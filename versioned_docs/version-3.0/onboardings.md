Good onboarding introduces new users to your mobile app's value, features, and usage tips. A clear onboarding experience boosts initial engagement, improves retention rates, and helps users get more value from your app.

Adapty's onboardings let your non-technical teams create attractive and customizable onboarding flows without coding. Our no-code builder helps you design a series of screens that guide users through their first app experience.

What makes Adapty's onboarding useful is the ability to add interactive questions that personalize the user journey. These questions direct users to different screens based on their answers, creating experiences that match different user needs.
For example, you can use onboarding questions to:

- Identify user types and show features that matter to them.
- Display relevant customer testimonials.
- Adjust tutorials based on experience level.
- Show use cases that fit the user's background.

This personalization helps each user quickly find value in your app, making them more likely to continue using your product.

You can also run A/B tests with different onboarding flows in Adapty to discover which versions perform better. This helps you refine your approach and create onboarding experiences that truly connect with users.
