Apple Ads Manager has a two-way integration with Apple Ads: you get near real-time performance data, and you can create and edit keywords directly from the Adapty dashboard in a much more convenient way than in the native UI.

If you create a keyword in the native Apple Ads dashboard, it will automatically appear in Apple Ads Manager within 24 hours.

In addition to [exploring comprehensive analytics](adapty-ads-manager-analytics.md), you can manage all your keyword settings:
- Add keywords to ad groups
- Add negative keywords
- Add keywords as SKAG (Single Keyword Ad Group)
- Edit keywords directly in the table
- Perform bulk actions on multiple keywords
- Launch & pause keywords

## What are keywords

Keywords are the search terms that trigger your ads to appear in App Store search results. They are organized within [ad groups](ads-manager-create-ad-group.md), which belong to [campaigns](ads-manager-create-campaign.md). This hierarchical structure allows you to organize and manage your advertising strategy effectively.

:::important
Keywords are only applicable for campaigns with **Search results** placement type. For campaigns with other placement types (Search tab or Product pages), keywords are not used.
:::

### Standard keywords

Standard keywords are the primary terms you bid on to trigger your ads. When users search for these terms in the App Store, your ad may appear in the search results.

### Negative keywords

Negative keywords prevent your ad from appearing in searches that are not relevant to your app. By adding negative keywords, you can reduce wasted spend on irrelevant searches.

Negative keywords can be added at the ad group level or as cross-group negative keywords that apply to multiple campaigns simultaneously.

### Keywords as SKAG (Single Keyword Ad Group)

SKAG (Single Keyword Ad Group) is a strategy where you create individual ad groups, each containing a single keyword. This approach allows you to:
- Gain precise control over bidding for high-value keywords
- Better analyze performance at the keyword level

SKAG is particularly useful for identifying top-performing keywords and maximizing their potential through dedicated ad groups.

## Add keywords

To add keywords to an ad group:

1. Go to **Ads Manager** from the sidebar menu. On any tab, click **+** above the table, then select **Add keywords** from the dropdown.

<ZoomImage id="add-keywords-action.webp" width="700px" /> 

2. In the modal, select the campaigns and ad groups you want to add keywords to. After selecting ad groups in one campaign, you can then select another campaign and add more ad groups to the list.

<ZoomImage id="select-ad-groups-keywords.webp" width="700px" />

3. Click **Select** to proceed.
4. In the **Add keywords** dialog, enter keywords in the **Keywords list** field. If you have a comma-delimited file with keywords, you can paste its contents so Apple Ads Manager uploads all the keywords in bulk.
5. For each keyword in the table, configure:
   - **Match type**: Select **Exact** or **Broad** match type
   - **CPT bid**: Set the maximum cost per tap bid for this keyword, or leave it empty to use the ad group's default max CPT bid
6. Review your keywords and click **Add X keywords** (where X is the number of keywords you're adding).

:::important
Once you save a keyword, its match type cannot be changed. If you need to change the match type, delete the keyword and add it again with the desired match type.

## Add negative keywords

To add negative keywords:

1. Go to **Ads Manager** from the sidebar menu. On any tab, click **+** above the table, then select **Add negative keywords** from the dropdown.
   <ZoomImage id="add-negative-keywords.webp" width="700px" />
2. In the **Add negative keywords to** modal, select on which level you want to add negative keywords:
   - **Selected campaigns**: Add campaign-level negative keywords.
   - **Selected ad groups**: Add ad-group level negative keywords.
   - **All ad groups in selected campaigns**: Add ad group-level negative keywords to all the ad groups in selected campaigns.
   :::note
   Consider the following:
   - Ad group-level negative keywords have higher priority than campaign-level negative keywords.
   - If you add negative keywords to all ad groups in selected campaigns, you'll need to add them manually if you decide to add new ad groups to the campaigns later.
   :::

  <ZoomImage id="select-campaigns.gif" width="700px" /> 

3. Enter negative keywords in the **Keywords list** field. If you have a comma-delimited file with keywords, you can paste its content, so Apple Ads Manager uploads all the keywords in bulk.
4. For each keyword in the table, select the **Match type**:
   - **Exact**: Excludes only the exact keyword or very close variations.
   - **Broad**: Excludes the keyword and related search terms.
      Or select checkboxes next to them and change the match type in bulk.
5. Review your negative keywords and click **Add X keywords** (where X is the number of keywords you're adding).

:::note
Cross-group negative keywords are particularly useful when you want to exclude certain search terms across multiple campaigns at once, saving time and ensuring consistency across your advertising strategy.

## Add keywords as SKAG

To add keywords as SKAG (Single Keyword Ad Group):

1. Go to **Ads Manager** from the sidebar menu. On any tab, click **+** above the table, then select **Add keywords as SKAG** from the dropdown.
   <ZoomImage id="add-skag-keywords.webp" width="700px" />
2. Select the campaigns where you want to create the SKAG ad groups. You can select multiple campaigns.
3. By default, new ad groups will be created with the default settings targeting all users. If you want to change it, select **Copy settings from ad group** and select an existing ad group to copy the settings from.
   <ZoomImage id="copy-settings-from-ad-group.webp" width="700px" />
4. Configure the settings for the new ad groups:
   - **Ad group name prefix**: Optional prefix to add to each ad group name (e.g., "SKAG_" will create "SKAG_keyword1", "SKAG_keyword2", etc.). You can click **Tag** to dynamically add the keyword, campaign name, and country to the group names.
   - **CPT bid** and **CPA cap**: Set the bid for all the keywords at once or select **Set CPT bid and CPA cap for each word manually** and set them for each keyword individually.
5. Enter keywords in the **Keywords list** field. If you have a comma-delimited file with keywords, you can paste its content, so Apple Ads Manager uploads all the keywords in bulk.
6. For each keyword in the table, select the **Match type**:
   - **Exact**: Matches only the exact keyword or very close variations
   - **Broad**: Matches the keyword and related search terms
     Or select checkboxes next to them and change the match type in bulk.
7. Select **Check for duplicates in target campaign** to ensure there are no identical keywords in the target campaigns.
8. Click **Create** to create the SKAG ad groups.

Each keyword will be placed in its own ad group within each selected campaign, allowing you to manage and optimize them independently.

## Edit keywords

To edit existing keywords:

1. Go to **Ads Manager > Keywords** or **Ads Manager > Negative keywords** and find the keyword you want to edit in the table, or navigate to a campaign page, then to an ad group page, and find the keyword.
2. Edit the values directly in the table:
   - **CPT bid**: Click on the bid value and enter a new maximum cost per tap bid
   - **Status**: Use the toggle switch to pause or activate the keyword

:::note
Edits to keywords made directly in Apple Ads sync automatically to Apple Ads Manager, but may take time to show in Apple Ads Manager.

## Bulk actions

You can perform bulk actions on multiple keywords to save time and manage your keywords more efficiently.

To perform bulk actions:

1. Go to **Ads Manager > Keywords** or **Ads Manager > Negative keywords** tab.
2. Select multiple keywords by checking the boxes next to the keywords you want to manage.
3. Click the **Actions** dropdown and select one of the following options:
   - **Add as keywords**: Add the selected keywords as standard keywords 
   - **Add as negative keywords**: Add the selected keywords as negative keywords 
   - **Add as SKAG**: Create Single Keyword Ad Groups for the selected keywords
   - **Activate**: Activate the selected keywords
   - **Pause**: Pause the selected keywords
   - **Edit CPT bids**: Edit the CPT bids for the selected keywords. You can edit them in different ways:
     - **Set to**: Set several bids to a specific amount.
     - **Increase by/decrease by**: Increase or decrease bids by a specific amount in USD or by the bid percent. Optionally, set the upper bid limit to avoid spending too much accidentally.
     - **Set to average CPT**: Use the CPT (cost-per-tap) metric to align the bid with it. Set a multiplier coefficient. For example, set the multiplier to 0.9 when performance is below expectations, or to 1.1 when it’s outperforming.
     - **Set to average CPA**: Use the CPA (cost-per-acquisition) metric to align the bid with it. Set a multiplier coefficient.

:::tip
Bulk actions are particularly useful for:
- Converting keywords between different types (standard, negative, SKAG)
- Quickly adding keywords with other match types for multiple keywords
- Filtering your top-performing keywords and adjusting their bids
- Identifying low-performing keywords and pausing them
