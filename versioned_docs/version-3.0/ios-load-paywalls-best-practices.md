In production iOS apps, the difference between a paywall that loads instantly and one that takes several seconds can directly impact your conversion rates and revenue.

### Why timing and caching matter

Paywall performance directly impacts both revenue and user experience. Production apps face complexities that simple demo code doesn’t address:

- A delay of even a few seconds in paywall loading can reduce conversion rates by double digit percentages

- Users expect instant responses to their actions. A paywall that appears after tapping *Upgrade* but takes 3+ seconds to load creates friction that kills purchase intent.

- Apps must gracefully handle cellular connections, poor signal areas, and complete network failures while still presenting functional paywalls.

- Multiple paywall locations throughout the app requiring coordinated loading strategies

This guide is designed to help you go beyond the simple “get it working” demo to thinking systematically about integrating paywalls and the IAP cycle into your app’s architecture, while maintaining the high quality UX your users expect.

### What you’ll learn

This guide provides production-ready patterns for:

- [Caching strategies](ios-caching-system.md) that work with Adapty's infrastructure and your app's architecture
- [Lifecycle integration](ios-lifecycle.md) patterns for app launch, backgrounding, and user session management
- [Choosing the best paywall type](ios-paywall-types.md) for your app’s needs, as well as loading and presenting the paywall most efficiently

### Pre-requisites

The examples and concepts in this guide assume the following knowledge:

- Familiarity with Swift Concurrency techniques such as async/await and the Observation framework
- Commonly used architecture patterns like MVVM and repositories

Whether you're implementing your first Adapty paywall or optimizing an existing production integration, this guide provides the architectural foundations you need to deliver fast, reliable paywall experiences at scale.
