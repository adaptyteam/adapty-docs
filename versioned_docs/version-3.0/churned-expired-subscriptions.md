The churned (expired) subscriptions chart displays the number of subscriptions that have expired, meaning that the user no longer has access to the premium features of the app. Typically, this occurs when the user decides to stop paying at the end of the subscription period for the app or encounters a billing issue.

### Calculation

The churned (expired) subscriptions chart calculation logic for Adapty involves counting the number of subscriptions that have expired during a given period. This includes users who have decided to stop paying for the app or those who have experienced billing issues. To obtain this chart, the number of expired subscriptions should be counted daily or monthly. At a daily resolution, the count of expired subscriptions represents the number of subscriptions that expired on that day, while at a monthly resolution, it represents the number of expired subscriptions during that month.

### Available filters and grouping

- ✅ Filter by: Attribution, country, paywall, store, product, and duration. 
- ✅ Group by: Expiration reason, product, country, store, paywall, duration, attribution status, attribution channel, attribution campaign, attribution ad group, attribution ad set, and attribution creative.
