If you've customized a paywall using the Paywall Builder, you don't need to worry about rendering it in your mobile app code to display it to the user. Such a paywall contains both what should be shown within the paywall and how it should be shown.

<SampleApp />

For detailed guidance on presenting paywalls within different frameworks, please refer to the specified topics on each framework:

- [iOS](ios-present-paywalls)
- [Android](android-present-paywalls)
- [Flutter](flutter-present-paywalls)
- [React Native](react-native-present-paywalls)
- [Unity](unity-present-paywalls)
- [Kotlin Multiplatform](kotlin-multiplatform-present-paywalls)

:::warning
The new Paywall Builder works with iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs version 3.0 or higher, and Flutter and Unity SDKs version 3.3.0 or higher. For presenting paywalls in Adapty SDK v2 designed with the legacy Paywall Builder, see [Display paywalls designed with legacy Paywall Builder](present-pb-paywalls).
