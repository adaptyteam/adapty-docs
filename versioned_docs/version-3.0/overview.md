  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */

On the left side of the panel, you’ll find the date and grouping tools:
1. **Dropdown calendar** — allows you to select a date range for the analytics displayed in the charts. You can choose from predefined ranges (e.g., last 3 days, last month, last 28 days, last 3 months) or set a custom range. Additionally, you can select the time unit for the charts: day, week, month, quarter, or year.
1. **Compare to** dropdown calendar — enables you to select a previous period for comparison with the current data range. Available presets include: previous period, previous month, previous quarter, previous year, or a custom period. On the chart, the compared data will appear as a differently colored line.
1. The final tool in the data tools set is the **Group by** dropdown list, which allows grouping by: country, store, or app. The charts will display the grouped information accordingly.

On the right side of the panel, you’ll find notification, metric editing, chart display, and data visualization tools:  

1. **Email reports** button — redirects to account settings, where you can select the frequency of email reports: daily, weekly, or monthly.  
1. **Edit metrics** button — opens additional control tools:  
   - **+ Add** button — provides a list of Overview metrics that you can choose to display in the section. As an additional feature, you can rearrange the order of charts using drag-and-drop.  
   - **Count installs** — clicking the dropdown list allows you to select the counting method: counting installs as new device_ids, customer_user_ids, or profiles in Adapty.  
   - **Time zone** — select your time zone to ensure accurate data.  
     Once the setup is complete, click the **Done** button to save the new preset.  
1. **Chart type** switcher — allows you to change the type of charts. The following chart types are available: stacked column, stacked area, line, 100% stacked column, 100% stacked area, and pie chart.  
1. **Revenue data** display switcher — offers three options for displaying revenue data on charts:

## Conversion analytics section

This section contains charts reflecting conversion metrics, such as:

If X is the number of installs (consistent across all products since no product is chosen at the installation stage), and Y is the number of those from X who paid, then Conversion = (Y / X) × 100%.  
1. **Install → Trial** chart — displays the percentage of users who installed the app on the selected date and later activated a trial. If X is the number of installs (consistent across all products since no product is chosen at the installation stage), and Y is the number of those from X who activated a trial, then Conversion = (Y / X) × 100%.  
1. **Trial → Paid** chart — displays the percentage of trials started during the selected period that later converted to paid subscriptions. If X is the number of trials started, and Y is the number of subscriptions activated after those trials, then Conversion = (Y / X) × 100%.
