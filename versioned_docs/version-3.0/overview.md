[Overview](https://app.adapty.io/overview) is a section of Adapty Dashboard that allows you to see multiple metrics in a single place. You can customize which charts you would like to see and view data for all of your apps at once (unlike in [Charts](charts) which you can use to dive deeper into a particular app).

It's located right under Home in the left-side menu:


<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/016b5bb-CleanShot_2024-01-22_at_18.38.162x.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





## Charts

Overview has the following charts available (you can click on the name to learn more about how we calculate it):

- [Revenue](revenue)
- [MRR](mrr)
- [ARR](arr)
- [ARPPU](arppu)
- [New trials](new-trials)
- [New subscriptions](reactivated-subscriptions)
- [Active trials](active-trials)
- [Active subscriptions](active-subscriptions)
- [New non-subscriptions](non-subscriptions)
- [Refund events](refund-events)
- [Refund money](refund-money)

You can customize which charts to show as well as their order. To do that, press Edit in the top-right corner and then either remove charts you don't need, add more or rearrange existing ones by drag and dropping. You can also customize Overview contents in the "Add" menu:


<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/d6220fa-CleanShot_2024-01-22_at_20.01.05.gif').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





## Controls

Controls for diving deeper into your data in Overview are very similar to what we have in [Charts](charts) — and most of them are described in [Analytics controls](controls-filters-grouping-compare-proceeds). 

There is one important difference though: you can group and filter by country, store, and, most notably, by app — as Overview shows data for all of your apps at once by default. This can be helpful to understand how each of your app contributes to your business metrics:


<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/ae3a913-CleanShot_2024-01-22_at_19.56.302x.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





:::note
**Timezone and install settings**

Note that these settings apply to all your apps and override what you have in [App settings](general).

- **Installs**: By default, installs are counted by `device_id`—a new installation or reinstallation on a device is counted as a separate install. You can change it by clicking **Edit**. For a detailed explanation of other options, see the [Installs definition for analytics](general#4-installs-definition-for-analytics) section.
- **Timezone**: By default, the timezone for the **Overview** page is inherited from one of your apps. If your apps have different reporting timezones, customize the Overview timezone by clicking **Edit** and selecting the appropriate option from the dropdown.
