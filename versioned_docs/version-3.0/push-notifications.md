Push notifications in the [Adapty iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/adapty/id6739359219) help you stay updated on what's happening with your apps in real time. Whether you're tracking new trials, subscription renewals, or installs, you'll get instant updates without checking the dashboard.

You can set default notification settings that apply to all apps, and then adjust them for specific apps if you need more control. This is especially useful when you're launching a new app and want to monitor early activity closely.

## Configure Push notifications

To configure push notifications in the Adapty iOS app:

1. Open the Adapty app. 
2. Go to **Settings → Notifications**. 
3. Tap **Enable notifications** to let the app send you notifications. 
4. Choose whether to use Default settings or configure notifications per app. Note that individual app settings override default settings.
5. Select which events you'd like to receive notifications for.
