## Manage subscription

On the **Manage subscription** tab, you can see your current subscription plan and change the payment method.

## User settings

On the **User settings** tab, you can toggle on the **Hide Paused by Default** switch. Then, paused campaigns, ad groups, and keywords will be hidden to help you focus on active performance data. Don't enable it if you experiment with launching and pausing different campaigns, ad groups, and keywords from time to time, so they need to be always accessible.
